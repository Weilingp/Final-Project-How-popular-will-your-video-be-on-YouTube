This is the final project for my Data Science BootCamp by WBS Coding School in 2022.

YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world next to Google. YouTube has a list of trending videos that is updated constantly. Analyzing these trending videos can give content creators greater perspective and knowledge for increasing their popularity and brand of their channels.
Besides helping professional YouTubers achieve their successful video marketing business, we also wish to support other non-professional YouTubers to improve their video more exposure rate and ultimately get the videos trended to match wide number of knowledge-searchers.
As of 2022, YouTube has 51+ million active channels and our friend Migul is one of the Youtuber creator. He made more than 100 videos and posted on different social median platforms. 

But he has two major problems. 
* He doesnot know how to make video popular or get video possible trended?
* He has to pent hours and hours a day to read comments from his audiants.

So,we as data science tranee would like to drive data to have a deeper understanding where his business postion is in YouTube world and find data-based solution for him.

* Here are our initial questions:
* What are YouTube Trending Videos?
* Where is Miguel's channel positioned in YouTube trending channel?
* How big share has this Channel compared to the rest of all others in    
    YouTube trending videos?
* How can he measure if his videos can be populer or not? 
* What are the most popular categories in trending video?
* Usually, how long did it take for a video to be trended?
* Which are the videos having the greatest number of likes?
* Has the higher views also more positive comments?
* What are the title types used in trending videos: pos,neg,neu? 
* Has more negative title higher number of views?


## Project Description
* The goal of this project is to analyze and predict what YouTube videos are trending from a dataset scraped from YouTube’s Trending Page in order to find common characteristics of trending videos and attempt to predict and reproduce results.
* To answer Miguels business question and find soluction for him to sort out spam comment and save time to read real opionions from his audients in an efficeint way. 
* This information could be valuable to other individual content creators who are interested in increasing their view rates, or for corporate clients  who are interested in using YouTube as an avenue for content creation.
