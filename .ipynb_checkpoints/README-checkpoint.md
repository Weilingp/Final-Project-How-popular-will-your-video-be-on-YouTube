# How_popular_will_this_video_be_on_YouTube_in_GB?
This is the final project for my Data Science BootCamp by WBS Coding School in 2022.

YouTube is a widely used and famous online video platform in the world today. YouTube has a list of trending videos that is updated constantly. Analyzing these trending videos can give content creators greater perspective and knowledge for increasing their popularity and brand of their channels.
Besides helping professional YouTubers achieve their successful video marketing business, we also wish to help other non-professional YouTubers get improve their video more exposure rate and ultimately get the videos trended to match wide number of knowledge-searchers.
So, here are our initial questions:
What are YouTube Trending Videos?
•	What are the most popular categories in trending video?
•	Usually, how long did it take for a video to be trended?
•	Which are the videos having the greatest number of likes?
•	Has the higher views also more positive comments?
•	What are the title type used in trending videos: pos,neg,neu? 

## Project Description
•	The goal of this project is to analyze and predict what YouTube videos are trending from a dataset scraped from YouTube’s Trending Page in order to find common characteristics of trending videos and attempt to predict and reproduce results.
•	This information could be valuable to individual content creators who are interested in increasing their view rates, or for corporate clients or individuals who are interested in using YouTube as an avenue for content creation.
