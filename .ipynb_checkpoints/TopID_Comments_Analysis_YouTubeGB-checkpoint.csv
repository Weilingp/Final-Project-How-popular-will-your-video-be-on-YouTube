If it wasn't mushrooms then it was something else altering his perception.

A dream come true. Wish me luck._ The End of the Tour ends with a plaintive cry into this celebrityobsessed wilderness.

"Sorry, I don't like it. What follows this statement is my opinion.n n Visually, the video is good but everything else is not meshing well. While Nicki Minaj is an incredible and amazing artist that I DO enjoy, it kind of seems like she was a last minute addon to try and save this hot mess of a song. Fergie's vocals are ok but ugh, the high pitched This is how we do is annoying. She's much more talented than this.  Lyrically, meh, not impressed. Then we come to the sampling. It's so mismatched and doesn't fit well together. There is no harmony between the two. Music should be flowing regardless of genre and this one doesn't. At least not for me.  All in all, I'd rather not listen to it again and even change the station to avoid doing so. By the way, I love me some Fergie Ferg but this just makes me want to stab a freshly sharpened pencil in both my ears. nnSo let the hate and insults begin because I disagree with the rest of the class.",0,0,Neutral

"What an egodriven, nonsensical, rude, & pretentious stunt. Such a pseudointellectual philosophybro behavior to attend a fashion event ~ironically~ to trash it ( if that makes any sense) as if the art, craftsmanship, and architecture that goes into fashion isn't of enough  or even MORE  merit than his abstract art.  Moreover, to grandstand to make such TRITE and OBNOXIOUS POINTS??? Sad really. How is sarcastic participation in the event an effective statement of defiance against forces of narcissism which dominate the industry HE MADE HIS FORTUNE ON at all? The way he circled that interviewer, made a bunch of nonsequiturs then deflected from her serious question about world events is the height of the pomposity he claims to despise. Why is no one showing up to car shows and belittling them for being a monument to a shallow, consumerist culture of excess, like he did to the economystimulating industry that is fashion?

"So everyone is complaining about new Asking Alexandria cause it's different. It's a thing called evolution, if a band releases the same bland metalcore over and over again, everyone gets tired of it. My problem with old Asking Alexandria is in Stand Up and Scream, the drums were sample city, and Danny's vocals were auto tuned to shit. Also the song titles were shit. Reckless and Relentless wasn't bad, but was still kinda meh because Danny's vocals were just really boring to listen to. Also the riffing and writing weren't anything special. From Death to Destiny's mixing was meh, the drums were sample city, but the vocals are amazing and the writing is better. The Black had terrible mixing and terrible writing. This has good writing, well done mixing, great vocals, though the chorus is a little bland with Danny just singing Into The Fire multiple times. Other than that, great song.",1,0,Neutral

These guys are fucking dancers but now we have Danny coming back strong and determined to try something new, something risky. Showing his ability to be a frontman.

"This hits home for me in so many ways. I listened to AA back when i was a teenager, 18 i think is when i first heard them. It was also around the same time i began heavily partying, doing drugs, abusing anything i could get my hands on. It led to being an alcoholic in my 20's that lasted up until about a year ago. Im 27 now and am only recently getting past addiction and being comfortable in my own skin. I wouldn't take back any of it, it taught me many lessons that few people learn and showed me a path few people see the other side of. As bad as it was it had some amazing moments. In the end i had to face myself and the wretch i had become to find the right way out. Its great to see Danny overcoming hopefully returning to AA but If he chooses to start a new path, i support it 100% Either way I will always be a fan of AA and Danny Worsnop.",0,0,Neutral

"Guys, this music video is so intense. The lyrics speak for them self. But let's decode the symbolism:nnThere are 2 versions of Danny, one dressed in white, displaying vulnerability, concern, and courage. And then there's this dark, sinister Danny, wreaking havoc on good Danny, and his Band Mates. We view Good Danny looking scared, standing over all of his Band Mates on the ground, hurt, struggling for life, but still clinging on out of strength. Then we see all the members of AA challenging dark Danny, speeding next to him, standing up to the car only to get hit, riding along side his chaos only to get destroyed. But ultimately, the only thing that can kill dark Danny, is good Danny. And he does it at the very end of the video. The neo noir film style really captures what these guys are going for I think. We know Danny left AA for a while because it just wasn't him anymore. But what if who he was at the time he left, was Dark Danny ? And his Band Mates did everything they could to help him, even though they potentially could get hurt by it... hence them getting killed in the video. I think this film showcases great camaraderie among brothers, that darkness still exists within light, inside all of us, and that's okay... And that you don't turn your back on someone, even if they are in a very dark place. I think this video lets us know that AA is back with a vengeance, and they are ready for the fire. nnI don't know though, just a theory.",1,0,Neutral

"Wow. Last year Subri's free kick was the clear winner, but this year for me there's no obvious winner. I could see the Camargo, Boateng, Mandzukic, Giroud, or the South African goalkeeper's goal winning it. They're all amazing, although Matic's goal is a little out of place. I would guess most people are going to vote for the Mandzukic goal because of the time and place, but I'd vote for the goalkeeper just because holy frak he's a goalkeeper.",0,0,Neutral

"Mankind now builds LNG ships. They are designed to refrigerate and transport Liquified Natural Gas. I've been wondering for some time what would happen if a vessel was built to carry Liquid Nitrogen which is now produced and used in Farming. Liquid Nitrogen is 289 degrees F and non toxic, about 78% of our atmosphere. I wonder what would happen if the full cargo of such a ship were discharged in the eye of a Hurricane. It would create tremendous pressure as it returned to a gas plus it would crash the temperature. Would be interesting to see how much was required. The place to hit a Hurricane would be off the coast of Africa while it was still forming. The downside is that it might be that the Earth needs these storms and there might be some disastrous effect if we didn't have them. Still, they do a lot of damage and preventing them might be worth the research and development of such a system if it could work.",0,0,Neutral

"So, just a critique... You don't have to equate the required amount of energy from hydrogen bombs to the amount of energy found within a hurricane. You would only need to detonate a blast large enough to dispel the hurricane just enough to spread into smaller storms more similar to those we experience on a daily basis. You do not need to entirely erase the hurricane. That is overkill if I've ever heard of it.nnThat said, this conceptual calculation is difficult.",0,0,Neutral

If you where flying that slow though you probably be flying at all, you'd be falling. And since a plane creates lift by moving forward into the air, you'd again be falling because there was not lift but what if this scenario could happen?",0,0,Neutral

Tsar bomba released 210,000 trillion Joules in under a second.  You then go on to make comparisons about the energy released by a hurricane in a day which is a timescale so much longer than that of a nuclear explosion that it's completely irrelevant.  You could definitely disrupt the aircurrents of a hurricane enough to make the hurricane dissipate with a nuclear weapon even smaller than Tsar bomba, but again, the fallout and winds make this an awful awful idea.",0,0,Neutral

"238 Tsar Bombas per day equates to 0.0027546296 per second. What do you mean that they aren't powerful enough?nA Tsar Bomba releases 2.1*10^17 J in total where as a hurricane releases 6*10^14 J per second. Results from Wikipedia link below. The majority of the energy from the bomb will be released within a few seconds, this combined with the fact it is 3 powers of ten higher suggests that there is enough energy in just one of the bombs to cause an impact or at least suggest that energy is not the reason it wouldn't work. Simply saying that the energy release isn't high enough is false. For that to be true the energy release would need to take longer than 350 seconds although as I said the rate of energy release from the explosion would probably be much higher in the start and reduce in a non linear fashion.n",0,0,Neutral

"Open offices are stupid. Companies that use them are just shortsighted. They try to save money in the short term, but lose in productivity and recruiting. Also the desire by management to put teams physically close together is unproductive. It creates a situation where people are too easily tempted to interrupt others who are trying to focus. Email and IM enable people to control those interruptions. It's hard to ignore someone standing in front of you at your desk. I'm most productive in highwalled cubicles or individual offices. I don't think I would work for a company with open offices. Also, people who like to communicate by mostly phone ...I hate them Mostly it's those people who are too lazy to walk to my desk and too lazy to write an email.

"Huzzah for #12 on Trending Can I just say I ADORE this guy's speaking voice? The first video I saw with him was about the oil on bowling lanes and I shared it with people because it was one of those things you don't realize you want to know more about, but is interesting and handy. The first Overrated epi I saw was the Qwerty Keyboard one. I wasn't sure how I felt about it. It seemed at first like it was bashing for bashing's sake. He said that using something without knowing why it's the thing we use is the definition of overrated, which isn't right. So in his POV, solo cups are vastly overrated? It felt like hating for no reason. The first Overrated video was about a specific book I wasn't that interested in, so I didn't watch it. So I expect it to be hit or miss, but if it sticks to broader things that most people deal with, like the way movie theaters work or tipping and why you up some people and cases in which you probably should tip people and you don't realize it, that would be more appealing to more people. The more specific you get, the fewer people watch, but the higher the level of interest. So broad and shallow may be the way to go if views are the goal. The point that the nuance is what's lacking in open offices is a very good point. They can't take half a recipe and expect to have a perfect result, and that's what many companies have done. Also, the open office thing came back after open floor plans in houses came back into vogue. I was a little surprised it wasn't mentioned, because that kind of carry over in thinking happens so often. But just because it increases functionality in one case doesn't mean it's ideal for another, and it's problematic for workers. I'm so happy that I work from home for now.  I'd get so much less done if I had to deal with other people stopping by or the loud chewing or talking of a nearby employee. I also get migraines from a lot of perfumes, so I'd be *that* person who always seems to make a fuss over nothing. All in all, it was a good video. Better than the previous episode.

"Sure, this idea could only come up in the US of the 1950's, were every atomic was cool. Like the 'Ford Fusion' which sould be powered by a nuclear reactor. Or the 'Atomic Engery Lab', containing real Uranium.n these hurrcianes may be caused by an invention of the Chinese. At least if you use some messages from Tump. What I found disturbing is a phrase I heard VERY often: 'This will take years to build it up again'. Or similar ones. Go back 72 years in history and look to Germany. After World War 2 everything was destroyed. No medicaments, no food, nothing. Not even a real currency. The most men were dead or in captivity. So Germany was mainly rebuilt by women, 'Tr眉mmerfrauen' (rubble women), as they are called. Sure there was help from other countries, but the US claims often enough to be a great country, so why should cleaning up after a hurricane take years?nnIt's more or less a matter of discipline. Some countries and their citizens simply can't manage this. Remember the earthquake in Haiti 2010? They've nothing visible done yet, although they got millions and help from all over the world. Lquila in Italy, after the earthquake 2009, still looks the same. Main cities in arabic war areas like Syria or Iraq are completely destroyed, they won't be rebuilt anymore in a similar way. In the opposite, after the Fukushima incident 2011 the Japanese were rather quick doing their cleanup. Now let's see how the USA as 'world leading nation' does.

I feel extremely rejuvenated during the transitional seasons of spring and autumn, and I find myself craving the change in my environment as I live in the countryside so I get the full scope of the season change in trees and such. I do love autumn, and will wear cosy jumpers and nestle up by the fire, but the commercialism of Autumn is getting a little wearing.

"This is interesting because I am someone who gets really heavily affected by SAD, and autumn has alwayyys been my least favourite season as my depression seems to hit me the worst during it. But in recent years it's started to grow on me, and I think a lot of that IS the grandeur that comes with the commercializations of autumn. Before when summer ended all I'd do is dread the lack of sunshine in the coming months, the rain and my seasonal affective disorder inevitably kicking in, and even though that's all still true, it's like my brain can be distracted like yeah it's going to get gloomy out, but pumpkin spice lattes are back Halloween decor Cozy spooky evenings and even though it's all done with the intent to sell stuff, I can't say I mind it for what it's worth.",43,3,Neutral

It stemmed from my parents break up and propelled by an abusive relationship.nnI'd found myself having secret weekends of eating.

After 48 hours of snap out of it and spit out my food and go back to normal.nnI gained so much weight and was so unhappy. It wasn't until I started therapy that I realised that I associated food to being happy, especially the Friday night takeaways with my family before mum and dad broke up. Main food was fried chicken, and I'd eat a lot of it. nnTwo years ago I went veggie and felt like I had some control. Then earlier this year I got ill. It's taken me months to work out what was wrong. Turned out that I have fat malabsorption (which causes horrid side effects).

"When I was around 13, the meaning of food suddenly and rapidly changed. I realized that I didn't look like every other girl and the idea hasn't really ever left my mind. I am not comfortable with people commenting on anything that I eat, I eat emotionally and when I'm not hungry. I prefer to eat by myself, and when I am around other people I'm very aware about how much everyone else is eating compared to me and if anyone says anything at all about my food that could be seen as negative, I lose my appetite and don't want to eat anymore. I struggle everyday with my feelings towards food, but hearing people talk about how they got over their issues with food helps me a little in trying to fix whats going on inside my head.",1,0,Neutral

"I don't know if you will get to read this because there are so many comments already I really relate to what you're saying, I was underweight because I couldn't eat when I was stressed, which was all the time pretty much. I struggled with food because of textures too Also, when I started up a relationship, with who is now my husband, everything changed for me. He was so encouraging and ate so many different foods, and there was no pressure to like them. If I didn't like a vegetable he would ask why and find something else I might get on with, or suggest cooking it in different ways like roasting broccoli for example. I don't eat perfectly but feel so much healthier, I'm happy with my weight and have alot more confidence in myself.

"Thank you for sharing this, KierannI used to struggle with eating disorders and when I'm in a bad place in my life, they would come back to haunt me. I recently made a big decision of following a long oppressed dream (becoming an artist) and everything immidiately clicked in place, including my relationship with food. I feel like eating disorders are often (at least for me) only the symptom of something else, something that  as you said  cannot be put into words, cannot be understood. So the ED becomes a cooping mechanism.nnRealizing this and turning my life around helped a great deal. Also educating myself on food in general and cutting meat and most of processed food out of my diet made me awere of my health more. Following you here and watching your food related videos always make me feel more confident and happy :D I'm not vegan, but I love how you show the world that veganism is not some kind of elite lifestyle for the priviliged, but something normal that can be enjoyed by anyone. :) Thank you ^^",0,0,Neutral

I so know the feeling. For years I've been struggling with weight loss my weight going always up an down. That is until almost 10 months ago I went vegeterian and like you said tried out a lot of new foods like lentils or all kind of veggies. Sure enough without even  focusing on it I slowly over the months lost some weight. I don't really like the scale so I only noticed It when my clothes especially pants felt looser and people started mention it. It really is a feeling from within it just feels right.

"Food has controlled my life. I've always been an over eater. After lots of therapy I realised I was an emotional secret eater. It stemmed from my parents break up and propelled by an abusive relationship.nnI'd found myself having secret weekends of eating. I had a process; all takeaways, eaten from the tubs (eating from the plate made it 'real food') and then throwing it in the outside bin. I would be on the verge of vomiting. After 48 hours of snap out of it and spit out my food and go back to normal.nnI gained so much weight and was so unhappy. It wasn't until I started therapy that I realised that I associated food to being happy, especially the Friday night takeaways with my family before mum and dad broke up. Main food was fried chicken, and I'd eat a lot of it. nnTwo years ago I went veggie and felt like I had some control. Then earlier this year I got ill. It's taken me months to work out what was wrong. Turned out that I have fat malabsorption (which causes horrid side effects). The theory is that my years of consuming high fat foods then stripping it back repeatedly ruined my gastric system.nnI'm now vegan and on the road to healing. I still have my moments when I just want to eat and eat and tell no one, but I'm open about it and tell my fella. Being not so secret about it make it easier to control.nnKeira  thank you for being so honest.

I am not comfortable with people commenting on anything that I eat, I eat emotionally and when I'm not hungry. I prefer to eat by myself, and when I am around other people I'm very aware about how much everyone else is eating compared to me and if anyone says anything at all about my food that could be seen as negative, I lose my appetite and don't want to eat anymore.

"When I was around 13, the meaning of food suddenly and rapidly changed. I realized that I didn't look like every other girl and the idea hasn't really ever left my mind. I am not comfortable with people commenting on anything that I eat, I eat emotionally and when I'm not hungry. I prefer to eat by myself, and when I am around other people I'm very aware about how much everyone else is eating compared to me and if anyone says anything at all about my food that could be seen as negative, I lose my appetite and don't want to eat anymore.

I recently made a big decision of following a long oppressed dream (becoming an artist) and everything immidiately clicked in place, including my relationship with food. I feel like eating disorders are often (at least for me) only the symptom of something else, something that  as you said  cannot be put into words, cannot be understood. So the ED becomes a cooping mechanism.nnRealizing this and turning my life around helped a great deal. Also educating myself on food in general and cutting meat and most of processed food out of my diet made me awere of my health more. Following you here and watching your food related videos always make me feel more confident and happy :D I'm not vegan, but I love how you show the world that veganism is not some kind of elite lifestyle for the priviliged, but something normal that can be enjoyed by anyone. :) Thank you ^^",0,0,Neutral

I so know the feeling. For years I've been struggling with weight loss my weight going always up an down.

"Food has controlled my life. I've always been an over eater. After lots of therapy I realised I was an emotional secret eater. It stemmed from my parents break up and propelled by an abusive relationship.nnI'd found myself having secret weekends of eating. I had a process; all takeaways, eaten from the tubs (eating from the plate made it 'real food') and then throwing it in the outside bin. I would be on the verge of vomiting. After 48 hours of snap out of it and spit out my food and go back to normal.nnI gained so much weight and was so unhappy. It wasn't until I started therapy that I realised that I associated food to being happy, especially the Friday night takeaways with my family before mum and dad broke up. Main food was fried chicken, and I'd eat a lot of it. nnTwo years ago I went veggie and felt like I had some control. Then earlier this year I got ill. It's taken me months to work out what was wrong. Turned out that I have fat malabsorption (which causes horrid side effects). The theory is that my years of consuming high fat foods then stripping it back repeatedly ruined my gastric system.nnI'm now vegan and on the road to healing. I still have my moments when I just want to eat and eat and tell no one, but I'm open about it and tell my fella. Being not so secret about it make it easier to control.nnKeira  thank you for being so honest.

"When I was around 13, the meaning of food suddenly and rapidly changed. I realized that I didn't look like every other girl and the idea hasn't really ever left my mind. I am not comfortable with people commenting on anything that I eat, I eat emotionally and when I'm not hungry. I prefer to eat by myself, and when I am around other people I'm very aware about how much everyone else is eating compared to me and if anyone says anything at all about my food that could be seen as negative, I lose my appetite and don't want to eat anymore.

I recently made a big decision of following a long oppressed dream (becoming an artist) and everything immidiately clicked in place, including my relationship with food. I feel like eating disorders are often (at least for me) only the symptom of something else, something that  as you said  cannot be put into words, cannot be understood. So the ED becomes a cooping mechanism.nnRealizing this and turning my life around helped a great deal. Also educating myself on food in general and cutting meat and most of processed food out of my diet made me awere of my health more. Following you here and watching your food related videos always make me feel more confident and happy :D I'm not vegan, but I love how you show the world that veganism is not some kind of elite lifestyle for the priviliged, but something normal that can be enjoyed by anyone. :) Thank you ^^",0,0,Neutral

"This video made me tear up. Your story is very similar to mine, wow. I did eat more of a variety of foods at home as a child, but still did a lot of overeating. The part where you talk about being a great student but still dreading school, being very introverted, wondering why you couldn't be like the other kids, was me as well. I'm in the process of making the switch to vegetarianism right now. Two months in, and I thought it would be hard, but I've been figuring out lots of recipes that I love which makes it easier every day. _わ_ (And trying to refrain from putting cheese on EVERYTHING .)

"I don't know if you will get to read this because there are so many comments already I really relate to what you're saying, I was underweight because I couldn't eat when I was stressed, which was all the time pretty much. I struggled with food because of textures too Also, when I started up a relationship, with who is now my husband, everything changed for me. He was so encouraging and ate so many different foods, and there was no pressure to like them. If I didn't like a vegetable he would ask why and find something else I might get on with, or suggest cooking it in different ways like roasting broccoli for example. I don't eat perfectly but feel so much healthier, I'm happy with my weight and have alot more confidence in myself. My point being that you've done amazingly, and I can really appreciate the progress you've made",0,0,Neutral

I so know the feeling. For years I've been struggling with weight loss my weight going always up an down. That is until almost 10 months ago I went vegeterian and like you said tried out a lot of new foods like lentils or all kind of veggies. Sure enough without even  focusing on it I slowly over the months lost some weight. I don't really like the scale so I only noticed It when my clothes especially pants felt looser and people started mention it. It really is a feeling from within it just feels right. A healthier mind got me a healthier body that I'm slowly accepting for what is :)  loved hearing of your story and experience. You show food in a very natural and easy way that I think a lot of people understand better myself included ,0,0,Neutral
"I can relate to this so much I've grown up as the most awkward fussy eater, my mom would always cook me my own separate dinner without any veggies in cause I hate certain textures. It's got so bad that me and my partners friends won't invite us out to certain restaurants because they worry I will not be able to eat anything on the menu  I feel like I really need to be open minded to trying new foods especially fruit and veg.

"Food has controlled my life. I've always been an over eater. After lots of therapy I realised I was an emotional secret eater. It stemmed from my parents break up and propelled by an abusive relationship.nnI'd found myself having secret weekends of eating. I had a process; all takeaways, eaten from the tubs (eating from the plate made it 'real food') and then throwing it in the outside bin. I would be on the verge of vomiting. After 48 hours of snap out of it and spit out my food and go back to normal.nnI gained so much weight and was so unhappy. It wasn't until I started therapy that I realised that I associated food to being happy, especially the Friday night takeaways with my family before mum and dad broke up. Main food was fried chicken, and I'd eat a lot of it. nnTwo years ago I went veggie and felt like I had some control. Then earlier this year I got ill. It's taken me months to work out what was wrong. Turned out that I have fat malabsorption (which causes horrid side effects). The theory is that my years of consuming high fat foods then stripping it back repeatedly ruined my gastric system.nnI'm now vegan and on the road to healing. I still have my moments when I just want to eat and eat and tell no one, but I'm open about it and tell my fella. Being not so secret about it make it easier to control.nnKeira  thank you for being so honest.

"When I was around 13, the meaning of food suddenly and rapidly changed. I realized that I didn't look like every other girl and the idea hasn't really ever left my mind. I am not comfortable with people commenting on anything that I eat, I eat emotionally and when I'm not hungry. I prefer to eat by myself, and when I am around other people I'm very aware about how much everyone else is eating compared to me and if anyone says anything at all about my food that could be seen as negative, I lose my appetite and don't want to eat anymore. I struggle everyday with my feelings towards food, but hearing people talk about how they got over their issues with food helps me a little in trying to fix whats going on inside my head.",3,0,Neutral

I turned to food to cope with what I was going through.  I turned 18 and found out I had PCOS, a genetic disorder that makes it difficult to loose weight due to imbalanced hormones.  My relationship with food has been a constant war every day for 22 years.  I was anorexic, bulimic and obsessive compulsive with food.  It has been the longest  battle in my life.  Some days it feels all consuming.  I tried going vegan but found it triggered my ocd.

"Thank you for sharing this, KierannI used to struggle with eating disorders and when I'm in a bad place in my life, they would come back to haunt me. I recently made a big decision of following a long oppressed dream (becoming an artist) and everything immidiately clicked in place, including my relationship with food. I feel like eating disorders are often (at least for me) only the symptom of something else, something that  as you said  cannot be put into words, cannot be understood. So the ED becomes a cooping mechanism.nnRealizing this and turning my life around helped a great deal. Also educating myself on food in general and cutting meat and most of processed food out of my diet made me awere of my health more. Following you here and watching your food related videos always make me feel more confident and happy :D I'm not vegan, but I love how you show the world that veganism is not some kind of elite lifestyle for the priviliged, but something normal that can be enjoyed by anyone. :) Thank you ^^",0,0,Neutral

"Food has controlled my life. I've always been an over eater. After lots of therapy I realised I was an emotional secret eater. It stemmed from my parents break up and propelled by an abusive relationship.nnI'd found myself having secret weekends of eating. I had a process; all takeaways, eaten from the tubs (eating from the plate made it 'real food') and then throwing it in the outside bin. I would be on the verge of vomiting. After 48 hours of snap out of it and spit out my food and go back to normal.nnI gained so much weight and was so unhappy. It wasn't until I started therapy that I realised that I associated food to being happy, especially the Friday night takeaways with my family before mum and dad broke up. Main food was fried chicken, and I'd eat a lot of it. nnTwo years ago I went veggie and felt like I had some control. Then earlier this year I got ill. It's taken me months to work out what was wrong. Turned out that I have fat malabsorption (which causes horrid side effects). The theory is that my years of consuming high fat foods then stripping it back repeatedly ruined my gastric system.nnI'm now vegan and on the road to healing. I still have my moments when I just want to eat and eat and tell no one, but I'm open about it and tell my fella. Being not so secret about it make it easier to control.nnKeira  thank you for being so honest.

"When I was around 13, the meaning of food suddenly and rapidly changed. I realized that I didn't look like every other girl and the idea hasn't really ever left my mind. I am not comfortable with people commenting on anything that I eat, I eat emotionally and when I'm not hungry. I prefer to eat by myself, and when I am around other people I'm very aware about how much everyone else is eating compared to me and if anyone says anything at all about my food that could be seen as negative, I lose my appetite and don't want to eat anymore. I struggle everyday with my feelings towards food, but hearing people talk about how they got over their issues with food helps me a little in trying to fix whats going on inside my head.",3,0,Neutral

I turned to food to cope with what I was going through.  I turned 18 and found out I had PCOS, a genetic disorder that makes it difficult to loose weight due to imbalanced hormones.  My relationship with food has been a constant war every day for 22 years.  I was anorexic, bulimic and obsessive compulsive with food.  It has been the longest  battle in my life.

I recently made a big decision of following a long oppressed dream (becoming an artist) and everything immidiately clicked in place, including my relationship with food. I feel like eating disorders are often (at least for me) only the symptom of something else, something that  as you said  cannot be put into words, cannot be understood. So the ED becomes a cooping mechanism.nnRealizing this and turning my life around helped a great deal. Also educating myself on food in general and cutting meat and most of processed food out of my diet made me awere of my health more.

"Food has controlled my life. I've always been an over eater. After lots of therapy I realised I was an emotional secret eater. It stemmed from my parents break up and propelled by an abusive relationship.nnI'd found myself having secret weekends of eating. I had a process; all takeaways, eaten from the tubs (eating from the plate made it 'real food') and then throwing it in the outside bin. I would be on the verge of vomiting. After 48 hours of snap out of it and spit out my food and go back to normal.nnI gained so much weight and was so unhappy. It wasn't until I started therapy that I realised that I associated food to being happy, especially the Friday night takeaways with my family before mum and dad broke up. Main food was fried chicken, and I'd eat a lot of it. nnTwo years ago I went veggie and felt like I had some control. Then earlier this year I got ill. It's taken me months to work out what was wrong. Turned out that I have fat malabsorption (which causes horrid side effects). The theory is that my years of consuming high fat foods then stripping it back repeatedly ruined my gastric system.nnI'm now vegan and on the road to healing. I still have my moments when I just want to eat and eat and tell no one, but I'm open about it and tell my fella.

I am not comfortable with people commenting on anything that I eat, I eat emotionally and when I'm not hungry. I prefer to eat by myself, and when I am around other people I'm very aware about how much everyone else is eating compared to me and if anyone says anything at all about my food that could be seen as negative, I lose my appetite and don't want to eat anymore.

"Food has controlled my life. I've always been an over eater. After lots of therapy I realised I was an emotional secret eater. It stemmed from my parents break up and propelled by an abusive relationship.nnI'd found myself having secret weekends of eating. I had a process; all takeaways, eaten from the tubs (eating from the plate made it 'real food') and then throwing it in the outside bin. I would be on the verge of vomiting. After 48 hours of snap out of it and spit out my food and go back to normal.nnI gained so much weight and was so unhappy. It wasn't until I started therapy that I realised that I associated food to being happy, especially the Friday night takeaways with my family before mum and dad broke up. Main food was fried chicken, and I'd eat a lot of it. nnTwo years ago I went veggie and felt like I had some control. Then earlier this year I got ill. It's taken me months to work out what was wrong. Turned out that I have fat malabsorption (which causes horrid side effects). The theory is that my years of consuming high fat foods then stripping it back repeatedly ruined my gastric system.nnI'm now vegan and on the road to healing. I still have my moments when I just want to eat and eat and tell no one, but I'm open about it and tell my fella. Being not so secret about it make it easier to control.nnKeira  thank you for being so honest.

Sure enough it wasn't the meat they were missing, it was cheese and milk chocolate. They had to go and buy some after three days. I'm not sure this is a universal thing, but for me it was an amazing change The only time (hilariously) I didn't experience food cravings was when I was pregnant.

"Thank you for sharing this, KierannI used to struggle with eating disorders and when I'm in a bad place in my life, they would come back to haunt me. I recently made a big decision of following a long oppressed dream (becoming an artist) and everything immidiately clicked in place, including my relationship with food. I feel like eating disorders are often (at least for me) only the symptom of something else, something that  as you said  cannot be put into words, cannot be understood. So the ED becomes a cooping mechanism.nnRealizing this and turning my life around helped a great deal. Also educating myself on food in general and cutting meat and most of processed food out of my diet made me awere of my health more. Following you here and watching your food related videos always make me feel more confident and happy :D I'm not vegan, but I love how you show the world that veganism is not some kind of elite lifestyle for the priviliged, but something normal that can be enjoyed by anyone. :) Thank you ^^",0,0,Neutral
"My cat came to sit with my when I clicked on your video. Kind of sweet :)nI (like so so so many others) have struggeled with food from a young age. I'm 29 and I'm still not OK with it, but since going vegan it's gotten better. I focus more on health than on weight and slowly but surely I think I'm actually heading somewhere :) nThank you so much for sharing. You're such a wonderful and inspiring human being xx",0,0,Neutral

"I had a very similar experience with food, I hadn't eaten onions until I was about 17 and only tried courgettes this year I do not like a lot of food textures and I have a lot of food aversions It was really nice listening to someone else talk about this The environment I grew up in wasn't good, and I was fed nothing but chicken nuggets and chips and other freezer food, when I moved in with my other parent at 14 it was mad, I'd never really seen fresh vegetables in my home before that and it's been such a long journey to start eating properly and enjoying food Cooking is a big part of my life now and I also find it very therapeutic I recently got into exercising, an I've been doing the wii fit aha, retro I know, but it's nice exercising when nobody can see you",0,0,Neutral

The part where you talk about being a great student but still dreading school, being very introverted, wondering why you couldn't be like the other kids, was me as well. I'm in the process of making the switch to vegetarianism right now.

"I don't know if you will get to read this because there are so many comments already I really relate to what you're saying, I was underweight because I couldn't eat when I was stressed, which was all the time pretty much. I struggled with food because of textures too Also, when I started up a relationship, with who is now my husband, everything changed for me. He was so encouraging and ate so many different foods, and there was no pressure to like them. If I didn't like a vegetable he would ask why and find something else I might get on with, or suggest cooking it in different ways like roasting broccoli for example. I don't eat perfectly but feel so much healthier, I'm happy with my weight and have alot more confidence in myself.

I so know the feeling. For years I've been struggling with weight loss my weight going always up an down. That is until almost 10 months ago I went vegeterian and like you said tried out a lot of new foods like lentils or all kind of veggies. Sure enough without even  focusing on it I slowly over the months lost some weight. I don't really like the scale so I only noticed It when my clothes especially pants felt looser and people started mention it. It really is a feeling from within it just feels right. A healthier mind got me a healthier body that I'm slowly accepting for what is :)  loved hearing of your story and experience.

"I can relate to this so much I've grown up as the most awkward fussy eater, my mom would always cook me my own separate dinner without any veggies in cause I hate certain textures.

"Food has controlled my life. I've always been an over eater. After lots of therapy I realised I was an emotional secret eater. It stemmed from my parents break up and propelled by an abusive relationship.nnI'd found myself having secret weekends of eating. I had a process; all takeaways, eaten from the tubs (eating from the plate made it 'real food') and then throwing it in the outside bin. I would be on the verge of vomiting. After 48 hours of snap out of it and spit out my food and go back to normal.nnI gained so much weight and was so unhappy. It wasn't until I started therapy that I realised that I associated food to being happy, especially the Friday night takeaways with my family before mum and dad broke up. Main food was fried chicken, and I'd eat a lot of it. nnTwo years ago I went veggie and felt like I had some control. Then earlier this year I got ill. It's taken me months to work out what was wrong. Turned out that I have fat malabsorption (which causes horrid side effects). The theory is that my years of consuming high fat foods then stripping it back repeatedly ruined my gastric system.nnI'm now vegan and on the road to healing. I still have my moments when I just want to eat and eat and tell no one, but I'm open about it and tell my fella. Being not so secret about it make it easier to control.nnKeira  thank you for being so honest.

Speedy little hairballs, ain't they? :) nnFor a minute there your clickbait title had me wondering if you actually found yourselves a Phoneutria somethingorother.
