I not sure why u hate trump. If u can see that America is a sinking ship then u are blind. I happy someone is fighting to bring back jobs and raise income levels. To me it hard to imagine America just 40 years ago and to think how far it fallen. You walk the streets and it almost like a third world country yet people think it the richest country in the world which it was but people don understand debt they don understand that America is flat broke and being held on life support with foreign loans. $20 trillion in debt who has ever heard of these numbers and yet they hate a man trying to bring the economy back. nLook I wanted Obama to be a good president but the fact is he damaged America more financially then any other president. Who doubles the debt that irresponsible and unfair on future generations. People don understand that there children will have to pay that back. So far trump is getting the economy back on track. He has never said a racist word so not sure how u can call him a racist. I just see him as trying to budget the books and bring America back into the black. Oh I must be racist because i said the word black  america has gone stupid and crazy,0,0,Positive

"Eminem has great talent. However,I am a believer of God that will be going to the Miltary to serve my Country that I love. These two things put me in a certain state of mind...The way to unite is not to condemn those who are against us .God will take care of that , the battle is already won. We must speak truth but in doing that let's show President Trump that we have a high standard for his Job title . We can't show him this by disrespecting him because he is still currently the leader of our Country ,Commander in Chief. We have to remember that our children's children will see what this generation of people in these times did and say just like we look at times before us. Let's start a movement of change  that represents who we want to be in this country and what we want our country to look like . Division from those who don't think like us by using words of hate is just as bad and can't create a world more of unity . Love creates love . Hate can't create love.",0,1,Positive

"If you're not familiar with Battle Rap, and you say this flow is wack without actually having any understanding of the presentation and the format of his material, then you're delusional. The flow was great, vernacular/vocabulary is still there, and immaculate rhyming as always; his internals are killer. He utilizes his literary devices very well, decent wordplay/metaphors/similies/assonance etc.,,, .nn Not to mention the ability to bend words with his annunciation to compose his rhymes as well. I think it's very dope to take two words that you couldn't think could rhyme and actually rhyme them without it sounding extremely forced. If you take closer notice as well, notice how he lines up the syllables as well. Execution still on point. Delivery was a little weak in the beginning, ok I admit, but he warmed up though and still not terribly bad. Another point as well, his ability to vary  his vocal pitch is something I've always admired about him as well. Still extremely technical. You cannot undermine his technicality. He is a beast.nnOverall,  Dude is still very skilled. Point Blank. Of course we've seen better. I personally think his Shady Cypher with Slaughterhouse is better, but he spoke his mind and still did a good job with  the composition and structure of his shit, and 90% of rappers today cannot do this and If they can do it, most likely they're a battle rapper and I can bet you on that as that is the very thread Eminem comes from. nnConclusion:  Shit ain't wack, Ya either hurt what he said, or ya don't know rap in it's entirety. nnGood Shit Shady, you facetious bastard..  #EverybodyHatesTrump #ImGrabbingIvankaByThePussy",0,0,Positive

"As inspiring as these lyrics were and this message is, reading the comments was equally uninspiring and disheartening. It's terrifying to know that no matter what Trump does his supporters will still back him. Eminem used his platform as one of the most well known artist ever (not just rappers) to bring to light issues that are incredibly important and need to be talked about. Charlottesville happened, Vegas happened, The terrible response to Puerto Rico happened, Trumps support of the kkk and obvious racism happened...ohhh and that little thing in North Korea is happening right before our very eyes Yet you still support him, there's so many more terrifying examples of Trumps awful leadership and yet you still support him no matter what. I so desperately wanted to put a question mark at the end of that last statement but at this point I know it to be fact. Maybe that's why Eminem felt it necessary to draw a line in the sand. I will say it's a sad day when any line needs to be drawn in the sand.",12,6,Positive

He's paid to do all this shit people,  don't you realize this man.

Common sense,  well only common to the woken the ones still asleep will not get it and will always follow the Hurd. Funny thing is,  he called out trump to say he's be flying around till the bombing stopped,  but, I bet EVERYTHING,  that this man right here talking this shit,  would he the first one in his underground mansion underneath his upper mansion. Also waiting for everything to stop.... He aint gonna be out there in the front lines helping us or taking action on the bullshit he just spoke and if ANY OF you believe that then I truly feel bad for yous,  sincerely.

Trump ain't rhe problem,  it's shit like this from powerful peoples getting us lower funded Americans rowd up angry ready to fight everyone,  going against our  leader no matter what we think bout him.  Ain't am easy job by any means PERIOD.  And fir anyone that's a believer of our Lord and savior which I hope everyone reading this stuff,  thw bible specifically says that we are to respect and follow our leader because they are out leader.somewhere on the lines of that but it most defInitely says were supposed to respect our leader as in our President .  What this man just did or is doing I should say is teaching the young people that look up to him unfortunately and the older fols such as myself all to go.against the bible and fall into the big agenda,  depopulation,  dumbing down and bring upon us our own destruction  . Understand yes this does sound a little outlandish but if you do your research and study for yourselves and read, look and pay attention to every thing happening in our world today specially our own country you will see how outlandish its actuallY NOT Much more id like to say friends and things i know I probably forgot but its late, I'm very tired and gonna stop before I start going off in different directions off topic etc etc.  Plus my wife is giving me that look,  ha.

All You just did was separate this country even more and fueled a fire that is already lit good job you must of been that broke to come out and do this. This doesn unite Americans and just shows the other side of the hate. The same racism you think he shows you just did in return. I served this country for 8 years and i don agree by any means how this was handled. Take some notes from logic that how you unite a divided front. #washedup #hasbeen,1,0,Positive

"Hey Eminem, let me go ahead and spit at younI'm gonna tell you straightup, dude, you're so hypocritical,nit's pitifulnYou call Trump a racist, yet you call him orange again and againnFrom what I know, the definition of racism is making fun of one's skin.nnYou think you're such a tough guy? Well, when you battle, it's Hollywood: fake scenes, fake dudes, and film crewsnTrump is fighting real enemies of America  ISIS, North Korea, and fake newsnnYou call Trump a Neo Nazi; are you that much of a pinhead? I mean, put both of you in a police lineup, you're the one that looks like a skinheadnnYou made your millions on the backs of young black men, infecting the minds of teens, selling them drugs, sex, and sin....nnNOW you suddenly care about gun violence? I'm about to lose it You are such a hypocrite because YOU GLORIFY GUN VIOLENCE IN EVERY OTHER LINE OF YOUR MUSICnnYou have a gift for rapping, so why not use it for good,n'cause your music has probably killed as many young black kids as your homie planned parenthoodnnYou talk about police brutality? Dude, is it even computing,nthat you're mad at the same cops that you and your boys rap about shooting?nnYou think Trump treats women bad? Listen to what YOUR songs say about females Bro, you are so lost that *cough, cough*..................nit's like you're hanging around Hillary's emails.nnYou're mad at Trump because he's rich? You yourself rap about money, so shouldn't he be your hero?nOh wait a minute, you rappers are just jealous because his bank account ends with a couple extra zeros nnYou act like you fight for civil rights? Raise your black power fist like an OG?nLast I checked, Trump donated more money than all of you to the NAACPnnSo while you used up your skill in your 40's, and your popularity and money are halfspent........nYou can say what you want about Trump; he is still our president",2,1,Positive

"He couldn't do it against Mariah Carey, now he tries dissing somebody else with insults. I thought he was better but apparently not, he's rich, butthurt and ignorant knowing that Obama deported more than 3 million people back in the day and invaded several countries where now you see ISIS spreading around. Obama signed a nuclear deal with Iran in order to provide a way for them to create a nuclear weapons and this whinning millionaire is supporting that? What about Libya ? Eminem is just another board chip piece of fu* who knows shit about the blessings he's received in comparisson to people in countries where the democrats have devastated lives for so long. I am just so glad I don't like his shitty music no longer. My comment ain't about supporting Trump, but Eminem is just another chess piece, just look at his fancy clothes while he singing about the poverty he's never lived. Just another Miley Cyrus on the way, brainwashed and completely out of place pretending he knows about politics just because he's got an oscar and fans to pay for his shows so he becomes richer. Underground? yeah, his crappy message is buried there already. Get your facts straight whiteprivileged rap singer in 2016 alone, the Obama administration dropped at least 26,171 bombs quote.... President Obama did reduce the number of US soldiers fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, but he dramatically expanded the air wars and the use of special operations forces around the globe. In 2016, US special operators could be found in 70% of the world nations, 138 countries _ a staggering jump of 130% since the days of the Bush administration.   bye and stop pretending you care about socials because you don't and you have made your money out of the same kind of politics Trump is putting over the table.",0,0,Positive

Also nice PC shots of random black dudes. Also what about the other 3 green berets who died along with him hm? The liberally media seems to just ignore them because they are white. They ALL deserve respect. Oh, and FYI, he never said he wanted to get rid of all the immigrants, or even all the illegal ones. Just the ones involved in illegal activity. That IT. IN FACT, he attempting to work with the ones already here...however it isn exactly healthy for our already in the toilet economy (thanks obama), to constantly be taking in more and more immigrants. Yeah they are people too, but there is ALREADY poverty and unemployment in the US, so before we start worrying about the problems of people in other countries, we ought to look after our own US citizen first REGARDLESS of ethnicity or skin tone.",0,0,Positive
