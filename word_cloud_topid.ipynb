How is price of potato?Take some more medication and hang out with child molesters in Hollywood Marshall Liberalism is a mental disease that meds can't fix.Eminem the Caucasian Tupac. Always speaking about what every other rapper too scared to mention in our corrupted society. Reason why they're the two greatest rappers ever in my eyes.Dayyyum i thought ry me a river_ was the white mans it em up_ but this shit hardTrump will send a nasty tweet and ban rapFreedom of speech is a mf lolI love Eminem so much more now. Can't wait for trump to tweet tomorrow at 3am how Eminem and BET has the lowest ratings ever in history lolGo back to doing drugs and talking about killing yourself & family. Also if people get to openly judge Donald Trump for his skin color/tone then it's acceptable to do the same of Blacks, Yellows, Browns, Reds... ect.Damn trump better not try to diss Eminem or it overI'm not a trump fan but this shit stupid. This white boy can wrap for shit.When you're the Greatest rapper of all time and spend the weekend binge watching CNN and the Jersey Shore Season 2...nice beard, bro.If you still support trump even after his views on Charlottesville AND Puerto Rico.... just kys youe the absolute definition of stupid _し_锔If you were his fan when he was talking about killing women you can stomach this tooDoes anyone have the lyrics of this freestyle? It would help a lot to non English Speakers like meWhere is the uncensored version? Not sure if you heard but you can swear on the internet. It's ok.Eminem, enjoy future concerts with nonbinary, safespace, selfloathing, political correct, Marxist liberals. That's your audience now. See how that works out for you.And of course people are going to say being racist is worse then deleting emailsBut do the retards that say that realize that she gave classified information away to the enemy and left a squadron to die in Benghazi even when they asked for airsupport. She let them to die. Our military, our brave soilders who put their life on the line to protect you and give you freedom. You wanna know what trump would've done in Benghazi? He wouldve gotten those soilders out and home, oh and keep in mind this was while Obama was in office and he did absolutely nothingEminem you're sounding old dude. But nice effort. nI don't like the thumb shaped cheeto eitherWow this is powerfulI wish I can talk like this at my job =*(This Is GOLD , Only Idiots and White weirdos Support Trump The Sick people of American#DumpTrumpWhere's the flow em? Dude stop this acapella nonsense pls.. go back to basics.Anyone know where to get the uncensored versionEminem is my favourite artist of all time. But this made me cringe a bit.Lol. Love Eminem and Trump. Makes me all excited when eminem tells me to f off.So much HATE ...meanwhile Il be eating popcorn  while watchingHey remember when he did that rap about Bush and then the one on Obama.....oh wait....wait....he didn't do one on Obama? It's almost like he wants to BE black so he does whatever he needs to do to get black people to love him.Damn a lot of Eminem dick suckers in the comment section lolEminem my favorite artist of all time and still kicking it. I grew up on Eminem #fucktrumpHe is a great rapper and this is a good cause, but the style of this video is just weird.all Trump supporters will have to say is hateful shit because honestly most of them aren't smart enough to understand what eminem is sayingbrainwashing at its finest, wonder how much he was paid to do thisAll his token black friends in the back are like _ this shit wack asf_Let's see if Em has a career after a few months. #kathygriffennWatch what you say about the President. nWe should never lose respect for the leadership of this country. That makes us look weak. #wackfreestyle#jussayimThank you Eminem......thank you for saying the truth.... thank you for having the Balls to say the truth about that Racist Filthy Pig ....donald trump.....No, Marshall, the age is kicking in bruh. Took me awhile to see if it was actually him. For a second i thought this was a parody.. It's been awhile since I saw him probably since Rap God.. It's also got to be the beard and I'm starting to see wrinkles. He looks so unrecognizable.It took 44 years for Eminem to grow 5 o'clock shadowCan someone please give me an example on how Trump is racist?Following Hollywood isn't always a good idea. This was a bad idea by emEminem looks like Mariah Carey when she dressed up as him in the Obsessed video.So here for thisEminem is such a loser, go back to the 90's with your crap rap..I not sure why u hate trump. If u can see that America is a sinking ship then u are blind. I happy someone is fighting to bring back jobs and raise income levels. To me it hard to imagine America just 40 years ago and to think how far it fallen. You walk the streets and it almost like a third world country yet people think it the richest country in the world which it was but people don understand debt they don understand that America is flat broke and being held on life support with foreign loans. $20 trillion in debt who has ever heard of these numbers and yet they hate a man trying to bring the economy back. nLook I wanted Obama to be a good president but the fact is he damaged America more financially then any other president. Who doubles the debt that irresponsible and unfair on future generations. People don understand that there children will have to pay that back. So far trump is getting the economy back on track. He has never said a racist word so not sure how u can call him a racist. I just see him as trying to budget the books and bring America back into the black. Oh I must be racist because i said the word black  america has gone stupid and crazyAnother superstar telling people how to think. I agree Trump is crazy but he isn't pure evil like everyone makes him out to be. Still better then Hillary.Wait until he drops his next album...Gonna be dope afTrump is 71 so he want live that much longer _I can tell he's upset obviously lol nBOW lol. Sounds like Resident Evil.nI'm sorry Eminem you sound dope. Just because your famous it doesn't mean you are the Pope.nMaybe you need to get a little bit older Cuz idubbbz is dope Becareful Eminem he will build a wall around your house and ban all rappers from America.YA THE VIDEO WAS FUNNY BUT COME ON CAN YOU GUYS REALLY SAY THIS WAS FIRENow its time to see who actually is an eminem fan.If you actually want to leave your best rapper who helped you when no one couldnt just because of some stupid president than you really never were a Stan.You people actually think Trump is in charge of your country? It doesn't matter who gets in, the same agenda will be played out. Learn to work together and live in peace. They want you to argue and fight amongst yourselves. It's classic divide and conquer techniques.CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE GET JA RULE TO GIVE HIS OPINION ON THIS MATTER? WE NEED JACan anyone make english subtitles to this? I appreciate that.Cuck God. I hope his new album is better than thisRise against Trump and his supporters. _The little snowflake _ Trumplets are gonna be triggered by this.Ah the perfect rapper to brain wash the youth to hate trump even moreEvery celebrity should go twitter and say salute the flag if your against Trump.Anything with Trump in the title beats Youtube's trending tab confirmedMoronic sheep in these comments dont even realize Em and Trump are both in the same Satanic team they will be sitting back laughing at all of you mental midgets while the fires burn around us.Lost respect for Eminem Trump is trying to drain the swamp from the 4 or 5 corrupt last presidents and its no where near easy for him, i wish eminem would leave out politics and he was right about Bush but now he seems to be on the side of evil and when has trump said anything racist? its clear eminem only watches mainstream newsO.. that was it? nnpft. nnI'm not Trump fan, but I do like some o' de ol Emineminem.. nnBut that was just old news being ranted between huffing and puffing..nCertainly did not live up to the hype.Didn't think eminem was retardedSome people hating and saying he fell off because this isn't a pop song with a hook. nnIt's a message that rhymes. Like real hip hop. Think of it as Street poetry. I'm waiting for the movie: trump supporters vs non trump supportersI'm just here for the insightful comments.Eminem is old. I used to love him until this. He's so rich and has to pretend to be poor and in touch with his blackies. I didn't know if I should laugh at him or cry for him.Y is bet helping the government stage a race war??All Ego bullshit, they don't care about real change.

I Love McDonaldAll these people are saying I lost respect for Eminem after this, he said clearly if you can't decide he'll do it for you so I don't think he cares...EMINEM is smart.., but seriously you F boys got to get off his INSANE hypocrisy and nuts nowIt's sad how he's desperate to be relevant again and he's cussing someone who's be cussed a billion timesGo vote and make a difference every body fighting makes America look so weak and we need to get togetherWait ...why is it so censored?Everything eminem has said about politics in his music in the past now means nothing to me. All the weight they used to hold has gone with this video. He has picked a political just side to stay relevant.funny how he is about to release new album in Nov and now is asskissing the establishment for exposure.. this is so fukin` pathetic....Em is so  much better than any other new rapper that it's not even funny. Literally nobody wants to beef with him566K Likes 65K DislikenThe comments sections has a disproportionate number of hate comments toward Eminem.  nThe Trump Russian Troll Factories and the USA redneck keyboard warriors are hard at work again. n Eminem is the best.It's sad that someone with really great lyrics is such a moron.the niggies are gona be all riled up over this lol. like they need another reason to violent savages.Shit, I think I'm going to stand by myself. #lineinthesandThrow that piece of shit against the wall til it sticks.He ain gonna do shit.

You tell it how it is.Lol Cringe, what's this gonna do? Overthrow him? Think Again. As much as I dont like the guy, no matter what people say, its not going to change.(Left): OMG this is amazing, we love Eminem even more now (Right): He's part of the antiwhite establishment, a washed up rapper looking for attention. He went in on Trump so he's no longer a great rapper.Ricegum is better than this Where's the un censored one?Isn't this guy in his mid 40's? He's a little old to be making little rhymesNow all we have to do is wait for Trump to respond.And don't tell us how to defend our families you and your bodyguardsour economy is up 5 trillion if y'all was leaders interested if following people blindly you might know this.He didn't have to say anything about trump or athletes or anything about America and he'd still be relevant. It's eminem he'll always be relevant.Eminem is the king that never diesHe's got a good way of putting things. RespectNext Video : Trump's reaction to Eminem's Youtube Video.Absolutely awesome As a black man raised in the 80s, this white guy is the only white musician with born skills in rapping who hasn't talked evil shit about black people. Like Eddie Murphy said_some of if you can learn but most of it you have to be born with. Eminem was born with it and talking for blacks and against Trump has gotten to be real uncommon nowadays with the innate white supremicists coming out and showing their Satan worshipping true nature. Kudos EminemTrump is such a moronI am Em fan, but why it's so cringy?Donald Trump Says He Would Vote for Eminem nGoosebumps all over... Donald Trump might start something the whole world cannot stop.

Fail.That's an aweful hot coffee pot, should i drop it on donald trump, problably not but thats all i got < whole freestyle summed up in the first line, eminem spitting fallacies and bullshit to encourage more sheep, 'omg eminem said this, my political view must change so i can be like the real slim shady' .. lmfao, buy into it libtards, buy into it. YOutube will make anything a trend so long as it agrees with their agenda. pathetic rap,  eminem hasnt been good for near 5 years.This guy popularized freestyle? Jesus that was horrible and hardly freestyle. A freestyle requires flow. This was slam poetry at its core. slim sheckle, the guy who talks about raping his mom with a chainsaw claims to be a moral arbiter and cant even come up with a steady rap about something he claims to care about.He sounds like hes battle rapping a ghost but nobody is hyping his wack shit upHahahahah poor guy but ya you are really a peaceful guy Subscribe so you likeWHOEVER GOES FOR TRUMP ,  LIKE THIS VIDThis is a big chance to break through some walls of ignorance  some Trumpers might actually listen Go EminemDamnnnn Eminem woke as hell  who would've thoughtobama started all this race shit now they wanna blame trumpFU@% that cracker ... if he really had to carry a tune he would be working at Jax car wash.

LMAO  Stick to NOT singing tooThis is all just a distraction to keep the world from knowing about all of the Hollywood pedophilic sex criminals getting exposedWhy did eminem have to get involved in this. I get he is one of the guys who is suppose to always give his opinion on important shit but eminem was my favorite rapper and he just talked shit about all my beliefs.

Listening to this degenerate taking the moral high ground  a good laugh though.Eminem has sparked a revolution. More celebrities, millionaires, billionaires CEO's , entertainers, athletes, politician's should come together. They should ALL come together and for 1 day or 1 Week and Every platform they have via social media or television should scream their disapproval of the president. They shouldn't do it in a PC way but truly say how they feel.Seems its about time for people of USA to unite and fight bridges not wallsThis sucked plain and simple.nI dont care about Trump,hes not my presidentnAnd Eminem is my favorite rapper but this didnt feel right, somethings off...nI just didnt feel this and I have been listening to this guy for over 10 yearshe's a punk ass bitchIt's was shit and I'm 33 Frankgoo Eminem, even though I don't live in the USA I agree with Eminem all the waySo are we supposed to be intimidated by the fatherless black thugs in the background if we are white republicans?  I love itEminem not as good as he once was but still 100% better than the whack rappers of this generationWhat do people want. What the hell did Donald Trump do to everybody. He's only one man that has to run the U.S. What the hell did Obama do?He used to be controversial. Now he's the on the side of the dominant culture. SadI find this offensiveJust in case you didn't know, Eminem has actually dissed Bush in his song Mosh. So no, it's not the first time he gets into politics.You ever see some shit so dumb that you can't even respond properly? Like, you got to deadass sit back and think... damn, this person really thought this out somehow, like in their heads? My reaction whenever Trump supporters utter wordsIt seem like everybody is hating what he said the man is speaking up for what's right all of you Trump supporters are the only ones who is hating the freestyleThis is so badI waiting for South Park to do something with this lmaoSoon somebody makes a beat for this n we gonna hear a nice track That Buick Grand National is on drag radials this is just frickin stupid . Like Eminem is a good judge of the world. What a bunch of trash seriouslywhere was he as OBAMA had dropped the bombs. 26000 bombs just in 2016 that's 3 bombs an hour crazy world and he got  the Nobel Peace PrizeTo be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand this diss track.Eminem: *he's Gunna get rid of all immigrants*n*He's gunna build dat thang up taller dan this*nLol Eminem kills me What a piece of shit moron wigger. Who cares what that idiot has to say about anything? Your rap sucks like all rap. Just do what you do best.

I don't care that it's about Trump. It's just sad.1:20 Except when it comes to having the balls to go against me you hide them... Just gotta say Trump tweets about everything the second it happens. It's been like 3 days since this video came out and no response from Trump. I'm just going to let Eminem finish this 1:25 Cause, you don't got the f*ckin nuts like an empty asylum...Guess who's back?I can wait for his albumIF EMINEM WASN'T RAP GIFTED MULTI MILLION AIRE AND JUST A GUY NAMED MARSHALL FROM DETROIT WHO'S UNEMPLOYED BECAUSE HIS CONGRESSMAN AND SENATORS MADE A DEAL WITH MEXICO FOR CHEAPER LABOR AND KICKBACKS I THINK YOU MIGHT SEE HIM AT A TRUMP RALLYi doubt this actually has 779k likes highest liked comment has 340 likes lulu can tell this was straight off the topYou know the rap is trash when the rapper uses the word 'Orange'All i have to say is anyone who pressed the dislike button on this video got buttyhurt _ typical trashy trAmp supporters  Eminem spitting bars BOY. _What a loser you are Em..............All my friends love Eminem, and I have to say that I love this rap.This is sad. Wasn't expecting Eminem to jump on the not my America bandwagon. But then again he does have a new album coming out in 30 days. Trying to get sales? This is the one album I won't buy from him. If your saying chose a side..... the President of America or Eminem???? Easy lolI am with you honey my fist balled up. I love you and appreciate your stand. Be real keep it real thank you for speaking for us _わ_I don't know if this is bad, or just different to his songs and therefore I have no freaking clue.This comment section be toxic af like GAW DAYUM I in the middle on this shit tbh. I ain an Eminem fan nor am I a trump supporter. But the most annoying part so far is Eminem dick riders like just stop... う锔The white is speaking and the blacks are staying quiet. RACISTWtf this sounds like shit feels bad he can only rap 2 sentences in a minuteThis is the shittiest dis track ever You ask America to stand up sorry but I think they are too busy taking a knee..........Awww, thats sad. Look at him trying to stay relevant. Nothing that he said was even intelligent.nI suppose that's the game,  when they start losing their fame,  old white rappers get lame, and they, start placing the blame...... I could do this shit all day.... rap is  stupid and easy. Just like hating the president.Whether you like or hate Trump, you gotta admit that this rap was garbage especially compared to Eminem's other raps. It has nothing to do with it being arcapella either, it just sucked as a rap XDKid Rock needs to slap this BITCH how to loose any respect you ever had in 4:35 minutes....nhow sad and kinda awkward that was.Trump is the new counter culture, the antipolitician. Kind of like Eminem used to be. Now he supports the establishment. Just a washed up, ignorant punk.All these white people be like wtf dude I liked u until u did thisIt don't feel rightBET by definition is racism at work.  Why to keep people devided.Love how all the of trump supporters and just general haters of Eminem continue to comment on his videos like it's going to change anyone's opinion or even his _If he gets an award for that, they should give out awards to everyone. Oh yeah they do...Slim daddy_い_い_いI Died You mad bro?didn't knew mortals could spit fireWhat a fucktard.enema manHmmmmmm....... deep or disingenuous?................. jury out....Nation anthemStay retired MNm.Disgusting videoCringeI missed eminemgoo.gl/sKApKR Subscribe Me Please _Imagine Trump responding with a diss trackNice buickWe all eminem....

However,I am a believer of God that will be going to the Miltary to serve my Country that I love. These two things put me in a certain state of mind...The way to unite is not to condemn those who are against us .God will take care of that , the battle is already won. We must speak truth but in doing that let's show President Trump that we have a high standard for his Job title . We can't show him this by disrespecting him because he is still currently the leader of our Country ,Commander in Chief. We have to remember that our children's children will see what this generation of people in these times did and say just like we look at times before us. Let's start a movement of change  that represents who we want to be in this country and what we want our country to look like . Division from those who don't think like us by using words of hate is just as bad and can't create a world more of unity . Love creates love . Hate can't create love.I am from Germany I undenderstand not much but Eminem fucked Trump  _That is not Eminem Look at his eyes Its a clone from him maybe.Diqqa thats weird. He is to old for rap or freestyle or hip hop now.Im reading most these comments and your all expecting some fire bars or a track ,he trying to convey a message which clearly means something ... yall to stupid to see thatEveryones knocking the delivery thats great and all i get it the flow isnt their but hes doing it angry NOT clear headed.. Some of u need to watch the news to know what hes talking about... Hes about to start world war 3 and some of you are still like  yay trump.... Idiots.... Its the lyrics not the delivery stop tryin to lip sync n rap to everything that plays off ur phone n focus on whats being said maybe u would understand more then just music but world issues as well... Hes 100% correct about all the issues he spoke of... Rest of u stop hoping theirs gunna be some catchy beat u can shake ur ass to and LISTENLame. Total sell out. Never buy another album from this has been.Yep I'm against Eminem you white trash.............do nothing bitch .......go back to your white trash supporters and your brothas in the kkk............is this a parody of what he thinks a political song should be?This shit sucks. I always wanted to rap like Eminem. Now I can.Everybody WHO Said Thats cringy have no mention about Music.. it Is es FREESTYLE... without a beat.

BETNetworks, an antiwhite racist organization is on the 'trending page'.Liberals are supporting him just because he is bashing Trump, not because it is good at all. I still haven't seen a single valid argument, fact presented, or debate entered into by a liberal. They just hate without reasons or logic. Please try to challenge your opinions in an actual discussion rather than assuming you are right. You will keep losing and Trump will keep winning... Your lives will continue to fall apart while we grow stronger... I love my enemies and i want you succeed and be happy. Please go towards learning and away from emotion.Omg no one have the balls to say this, eminem is a geniusnI love Eminem, Trump Sucks nLike if you agreehe is a god a rapgodFk yeah I hate Trump.. what a Idiot he is.*TRIGGERED*What an angry little commie pislamic wigger bitch.BL_ BL_ BL_ BL_....

So shut up and walk.Trump is Killing us softly and at least Em is other celeb are speaking the truth.  Fuk that puto trumpTrump supporters = disgusting nazisTrump is a peace of SHIT      Look at all the stupid ass trump supporters and Russian infiltrators acting like trump supporters. You motherfuckers know this shit is FIRELook at that like to dislike ratio. Looks like the majority of America stands with Eminem. Get wrecked Trump bitches.This is why the electoral college chooses the president. You can't go and trust a huge number of morons to decide who's gonna be running shit.Politics has to kill everything I like doesn't it. The only thing politics doesn't kill that I like is politics itself and that's debatable to whether or not it's killing itself.Trump is our hopeYessir EminemIts always anti trump stuff is always trending on youtubeim ashamed for him. this is hard to watch.Draws a line in the sand to his fans huh?    His dwindling fan base that is lol.   This is just sad to me.   If this guy from white, middle class 10 Mile Rd. (not a run down trailer park on 8 Mile Rd.) is such a good freestyler, why did it take him 10 months to serve his globalist masters and go after Trump?What a pile of shitYa Trump no Balls , Yet everyone scared sh@%t he goin to drop bombs . You swear so cool , now don't be scared .Eminem what a tool. Glad I deleted all my pirated Eminem music a long time ago.sucks to be a trump sucker now.Trump is a creation of the U.S. twisted politcal system. What was the alternative? The warmongering corporate puppet Hilary Clinton who along with the DNC were proven to have sabotaged the campaign of the man who should be sitting in the Whitehouse today? Americans need to draw a line, but not between each other Eminem, but against the twisted circus that is US politics and an out of control media.Eminem dissed Hilary Clinton on his track Role Model from almost 20 years ago and now they are on the same side? As a long time Eminem fan I smdh on this Oh god just stop... this shit is so cringy to watch... what happened to eminem. His rhymes weren even good..All I see is white people hating lol they never used their accounts until now. They really pissed hahahaThis video is so horrible even the Elites are like we fucked up Lol. Thank you for no true answer to what really happened in Vegas No answer$ Now u want us to believe this shit?Celebs call Trump a pervert or sexist, yet they allowed Weinstein to continually sexually assault women for 20 years. Up to a 100 different people knew what he was doing, but no one came forward. Bunch of cowards. We've only heard from the Women who said NO. Imagine the dozens who said yes, and are too embarrassed or signed NDA's to come forward. He was a huge supporter of Hillary of course, seems most wealthy predators are. Maybe they just like her husband loldonald the bitch oh wow you're being real edgy there kidHush lil baby don't you cry. Everything's gonna be alright  Eminem MockingbirdEminem but you don't say s*** and lafanda  dames didn't say it on 911 because you was swallowing dicks..... ahhhhh that S*** hurts so much when it goes all the way down your throat and the dick starts breaking ya ribs.......I call Eminem the new Dennis Rodman friends with Kim Jon un.... let everyone call out a fake rapper, either he she shows or she doesn't..... to fight for whatever she believes in...at@eminemillfuckup. And lets see how tough Marsha is.em great job but dont people say somthing about u and the satan u prey nowHe looks like such a dad with that scraggly beard.Wow, I thought Eminem was bigger than that. You played that card, so easy to agree with what everybody else has already said. Why don't you address how he brought back jobs to your hometown, or did your forget.  Who cares, its just more dollars to him, you not only lost a fan, but my respect too. Really Disappointed =(The dare devil is back. Rap God. Inspiration for billions. And me the worshipper of him.this is foreal the funniest shit ive ever seen/heard in my life. if he's trollin, he did a damn good job.nM A G ASo if we join eminems side, wtf is he going to do for us? lolGUYS CHECK MY MUSIC OUT IMA NEW ARTIST ON THE COME UP IT WOULD BE A BLESSING Remember the good old times when Em' made fun of the Celebs he despised? I doTrump got an big L thereI feel like the dichotomy that he set up was unfair.I don't know who forced him to do this but it's as cringeworthy as it gets.Feminem sucking to many BBC's..Why is everyone having a shitAll of a sudden he can grow a beard?I don like trump but this is shityim sorry lowkey it was trash he can do better and i know all the dickriders gone complain but it is what isYou ruin the name of good candy.he looks so weird with a beardhow did this fat guy with a pedo beard get 915k likes? and wheres Eminem?I cringing so hard right nowTrump is really powerful. Look how many celebrities he gets to lose their minds and give him constant attention...it's astonishing. _Calling DJ Trump a racist come on, really?THIS WHITE RAPPER IS WACK RACIST ASS nTHAT WHOLE EMINEM VIDEO WAS ANOTHER SUBLIMINAL WHITE PROPAGANDA DEPICTING BLACKS AS SUBSERVIENT TO WHITES. nnWHY MSM ALL JOCKIN' HIM? WHEN OTHER BLACK RAPPERS HAVE DONE MUCH BETTER LYRICALLY? nnWHITE AMERICA STILL DON'T ACCEPT BLACK RAP nnTHIS SOME LOWKEY RACIST BULLLLSHITWell eminem just told me never to buy any of his music. Well, at least we have his permission to boycott him.Racisms the only thing he's FANTASTIC 4 coz that's how he gets his ROCKS off an he's orangeAw come on Marshall. We know you're just trying to promote a new album with this bs. You voted for Trump and you know it.Here in my garageOkay... What was that garbage?nI liked Eminem a couple of albums ago. I also voted for, and support Donald Trump. It seems like Eminem has lost touch with common sense and reality. He should stay out of politics because his lack of knowledge was obvious in those terrible rhymes and it just makes him look like an idiot to those of us who paid for his merchandise to get him where he is today. I feel like I wasted my money on his crap now and have just been insulted.nnHe actually sounds dumber than the people he poorly, and desperately, trying to rap against. Wel all know better now... I guess. nnPeople Con seriously??? That was just terrible gibberish He obviously just used the lame subject of popular entertainment industry political views as an umbrella topic to crap out whatever that was. Those dudes standing around, listening to that trash, look like a captive audience. Obviously their under his financial wing in some form... but I sure theyl say otherwise if you ask them in public. nnOnce again for emphasis  People Why don all of you antiRepublicans take a few minutes to simply Google the history of the opposing political party these people are supporting...nnI encourage you to start by checking out the simple crayola crayon style  YouTube video entitled, he Inconvenient truth about the Democratic Party_ just to get started. Then PLEASE dig further and deeper for more of the truth because it may surprise you.nnWhatever the case, quit listening to the pop culture entertainment industry nonsense and take a moment to understand reality.nUse your own ideas to draw your own conclusions... Kind Regardspretty sure 900 thousand is bigger than trumps tiny hands.lovely to see the illuminati scream HELP all these STARS against TRUMP coz they been payed by Hillary and the CLAN TRUTH going to set you freeDonald Trump isn my presidentnnnnnBecause I British :PWhere was he 2 years ago? Suddenly he wants to pull a stunt because he's dropping an album in November? This low iq has been is as racist as anyone can get.Gotdamn It took a white man to say what everyone is already thinking, even Republicans.Id like to see the haters do better instead of wine and complain. Easy to be a critic, hard to have raw talent. Talking to you... the deep throated Trump suckers.all you idiots dissing em understand what he mean before talking down on em you damn Trump supporters...Is it just me or does he look like the guy from the movie 8 mileTell em eminem your the best _锯_锯_#fucktrump2017I'm amazed at those who still have enough stupidity in them to support Trump.nnThe president is completely incompetent. nHis idea of healthcare reform is poor, and his consistent bickering with an unusually agreeable Congress over the subject only reinforces that.nnNo national leader in their right mind would insult the mayor of a city AND blatantly communicate their suspicion of said mayor because their race, all while in nthe aftermath of a terrorist attack on their city.nnThis guy actually told his supporters that deporting dreamers was economically a good idea, and somehow many idiots believed him.nnThe list goes on...Its funny how many triggered conservatives there are calling him trash because of his opinion and saying he's just following mainstream media, but if he was supporting Trump and liberals got mad we'd be called triggered snowflakes.Daaamnn. nnI'm so glad I'm not Donald trump right now.Whether you like Eminem or you don this is real as it gets. Making a remark on trump more of words thought already been said. Yll can call it attention seeking but needa realize he standing up for what right, before yll be the ones to be seeking for your rights This didn't take balls. nnTakes balls to go AGAINST society.nnLiberalism is NOT counter culture.   Liberalism IS the culture. nnYou aren't raging against the machine. nnYou are just another boring cog in itWell said Em.

Listen to his track Low down and Shifty from 1997. Just epic Yeah, this is great because talking shit about Trump is a completely original idea which is very, very edgy and not overdone and boring at all.Hello from Dixie normousThis sucks cause it makes no sense..  ugh... sucks.. I liked em.. fkn keap is White and Black. Srry em. Bye...havent seen this much cringe in a long time thanks eminem :)Yo I agree with this 100% love u Eminem forever broI think em is the president nowThat ain't EM lol,this is 3rd different MF,I caught it but didn't wanna believe it,but a couple other people caught it too.The rap was cool thats all i dont care about the politics behind it because what America does is beyond my control, im not an american and its not as if a single comment on a video can change what he might do. So if you guys can stop whining about whether trump is good or bad, and just realize that everyone has their own opinions and whining about it wont help, it would be great.Am i the only one who thinks Eminem is getting old now.. dam bro shave the beard it doesn't fit you or maybe its just me..#This is one of the gayest raps ever. Thanks for drawing that line in the sand marshflakeBarack Obama was pretty racist, all I heard during his 2 terms was white cops shot black guy over and over and over again.nnMeanwhile you find out far more white people are shot and killed by cops and black cops kill black guys as well.He has done betterYknow for all the people saying this was bad or crying about how Eminem could ever talk about politics(lol I dont even listen to Em that much and I know he speaks on politics a good amount) havent seen one actual argument against what he said.  Even other Republicans are disagreeing with him or flat out endorsing his impeachment. Plus like really how is Nazis marching in the streets( yknow the guys who the whole US Army fought during the 2nd World War and gassed millions of people to death) less bad than football players kneeling. Lol thats infinitely more disrespectful specifically to WW2 vets the few that are left, not to mention the many vets coming home. Thats basically one small point out of many Eminem speaks on.All the troll over the world is alike.nI love you, But this...nYou sound like you troll is Robots, without any thought of your own. Made in Russia. Paid by Trump.Man Eminem is really trash now it's kinda disappointingI like you alot eminem. Your music is amazing. But i gotta say i disagree with you on this one.The actual M & M M&M's Milk Chocolate Candies have more street cred than this old man does nowThis is such a stupid, stupid video lolI wear a hoodie cause it makes me look tough,,,,, but underneath I'm really skinny,,,, kinda frail,,,, hell,,   I think I'll freestyle now,,, holy cow,,,,  my X is a fat cow,,,, think I'll bow,,,, down to the man, ,,,who has a game plan, ,, his name is Trump and I'm jealous,,,, like a little bitch,,, I can't take this shit,,,,, I can't rhyme,,, way past my time,,, I'm done Later sonYour too old let goIf you're not familiar with Battle Rap, and you say this flow is wack without actually having any understanding of the presentation and the format of his material, then you're delusional. The flow was great, vernacular/vocabulary is still there, and immaculate rhyming as always; his internals are killer. He utilizes his literary devices very well, decent wordplay/metaphors/similies/assonance etc.,,, .nn Not to mention the ability to bend words with his annunciation to compose his rhymes as well. I think it's very dope to take two words that you couldn't think could rhyme and actually rhyme them without it sounding extremely forced. If you take closer notice as well, notice how he lines up the syllables as well. Execution still on point. Delivery was a little weak in the beginning, ok I admit, but he warmed up though and still not terribly bad. Another point as well, his ability to vary  his vocal pitch is something I've always admired about him as well. Still extremely technical. You cannot undermine his technicality. He is a beast.nnOverall,  Dude is still very skilled. Point Blank. Of course we've seen better. I personally think his Shady Cypher with Slaughterhouse is better, but he spoke his mind and still did a good job with  the composition and structure of his shit, and 90% of rappers today cannot do this and If they can do it, most likely they're a battle rapper and I can bet you on that as that is the very thread Eminem comes from. nnConclusion:  Shit ain't wack, Ya either hurt what he said, or ya don't know rap in it's entirety. nnGood Shit Shady, you facetious bastard..  #EverybodyHatesTrump #ImGrabbingIvankaByThePussyRemember when the media was against eminem? Remember when the radio wouldn't play his songs? Remember when the media said eminem was the cause of school shootings? Remember when the media said eminem was the reason gang violence was so high? Remember when the media said eminem was the reason kids joined gangs? Remember when the media hated eminem? Remember when he proved the media are a bunch of liars?nnNow he jumps on the bandwagon with the media, the same media that hounded him and demonized him for decades. Pulling the same shit the media did to him. Pathetic.y is this blowing up lolM a legend foreverTRUE THAT. Love it.ALICE IN WONDERLAND USA/ WORLDEveryone including Eminem barking on the wrong treeEminem acting like a foolThat mighte been the most least informed string of sentences Ie ever heardI like Eminem, but politics aside, this was just bad.

Looks like he is a dumbf*ck just like so many others. It looks like the real slim shady just sat down for good. Good job MarshalThe rhyme was great but next time do it in a studio with no friends in the back ground .... there was no need to have them there .. it feels like you were giving them fame for no reason ...... keep it real and like i said the rhymes were deep and great .... I pray for AmericaThis shit is like watching the illest rap battle on KOTD or Smack URL. New days are coming for hiphop. Big shouts to you EM.

Everyone of those black chaps have stuck there dongas in m&ms clam fleshEminem hasn't been a decent rapper since Devils Night. I literally listened to The Eminem Show once through and threw it in the trash.Well I used to be a fan of you Em. Until I saw this. Now I realize youe just a bum ass rapper complaining about the results of democracy.. You will NOT reverse democracy, and the fact that you are helping in an effort to do so is the most unamerican thing youe ever done. Youe a stainthis is what democracy looks like ...derpSlim what the hell is this crap ? you made yourself look like a fool with this bro No. Please stop, youe just a washed up rapper that left a legacy. Stop trying to be relevant and step out of politics, some of your songs mention you raping women and getting into gang related shit. Youe even been caught beating your own wife. Youe no one to speak about his policies, and btw, youe a little late with pointing out his an_ is orange.So ..Em went from making his career off of music talking about how much he hates his baby mama, his own Mom, and the LGBT community but suddenly he's a leftist knight in armor? Lmao make up your mind my dude. I don't even support Trump but this rap was whack.What a disaster, amazing I once thought this punk had some talent.omg ... DIVIDE TO CONQUER, RIGHT?

And you cant shoot for shit, so beware of a civil war you pussies.Thank u for trying to split our country up even more then it already israp is crap.how this trash became actual music is beyond me.as long as the rapper shuts up the music would be decent without lyrics.Yo dis for collin, ball up a fist, and keep that shit balled he looks like a child throwing a tantrum.That was a slick songbird McCain shout out.Time for Eminem, CNN, Hollywood and their elite globalists to move on or move to Mexico and take your illegals with you. Pack of morons.It's pretty funny seeing people who don't listen to Eminem talk about his music like they know it. Also pretty funny how all the former fans of Eminem who support Trump are all butthurt.Im just here to laugh at the offended trump supporters lolI'm not sure if America likes being the world's laughing stock at this point, or if it's people are actually going to stand up against their horrid government.Hope you guys are not that stupid because he probably HAD A BEAT GOING ON IN HIS HEAD but the real meaning of A CYPHER is you freestyle without out a beat and if you think it's easy try FREESTYLING about a TOPIC OF A DISSthis clown was very silent when Obama was in charge.. and lots of Africans were murdered by authorities..but nothing saidthis is so cringey....haha im laughing so much. what an idiot. this seems like an SNL skit at first. man this dude sucks now.Shut the hell up you dont know what your talking about your a dumb assYou're one liners about Bill and Bush are 100 times better than this slam poetry set in a closed parking garage.nnFrom the voice of the working people to the mouth peace of the elites.nnLol dichotomies.

I mean, yeah, politics is notoriously bad for publicity but this was actually some decent shit off the cuff.I prefer the more technical raps of Eminem, this one isn't one of his greatest. This will lose Eminem a lot of his fans. You can see by the dislike button, Trump said what he wanted to do and people voted for it. The majority of people like him.Over all Donald Trump is still president marshall is pissed. i feel you, brother.Geez, women 15 years ago, when Em was relevant, weren't dick riding as hard as the fanboys here.

Lol.All these Dislikes need to get a lifeEMINEM IS ON THE VALIUM AGAIN.GEEZ,YOU JUST AIN'T RELEVANT ANYMORE.If this was about obama people would've called Eminem a racistI've seen Eminem at so much better, this was kinda bad, cause we all know how great he can be. I don't like to bring in politics to music, I love Green Day and I'm a Trump supporter and they openly don't support the president, which I'm completely fine with they have every right to their own opinion, problem I have with this is that he completely alienated half his audience including me so guess I won't be listening to Eminem any moreThat's not disrespecting the military lolthis dude was known for being controversial. he certainly left that behind. playing his cards safe these days.Eminem is the BossWhy is Shia Le Beouf rapping about Donald Trump?I like that he went after Trump, but he needs to junk this flow.nnHe used it in Campaign Speech and it fell flat there too.Omg Why did the greatest rapper ripped of Trump?...

But not once did he mention the trans ban on the military. He only focuses on racism. What is Eminem's ideals on the ban of transgenders in the military? If you listen to his older music it would lead you to believe that he is against transgenders and in that sense he agrees with Trump. I believe everyone is equil and anyone has the right to serve this country.What a shit weak freestylenn <*anyways guys check this out eminem is now on President Trump side* Kim jong un does not pee or poop he does not have a buttholeBruh a beard can make a big differenceWhy he look like Jesse from bf vs gfThis ain't meant to be his best.nIt's meant to be a message.nYou ain't no real fan.HAPPY BIRTHDAY EMINEM..(The King Of Rap)PLEASE SUB TO more.

Politics aside, the rap sucked.Snowflake in the house.  Go see a Dr. for the cure for Liberalism.He sounds like he's going to cry.As inspiring as these lyrics were and this message is, reading the comments was equally uninspiring and disheartening. It's terrifying to know that no matter what Trump does his supporters will still back him. Eminem used his platform as one of the most well known artist ever (not just rappers) to bring to light issues that are incredibly important and need to be talked about. Charlottesville happened, Vegas happened, The terrible response to Puerto Rico happened, Trumps support of the kkk and obvious racism happened...ohhh and that little thing in North Korea is happening right before our very eyes Yet you still support him, there's so many more terrifying examples of Trumps awful leadership and yet you still support him no matter what. I so desperately wanted to put a question mark at the end of that last statement but at this point I know it to be fact. Maybe that's why Eminem felt it necessary to draw a line in the sand. I will say it's a sad day when any line needs to be drawn in the sand.This is cringe and whack as shit and this is coming from a former long time fan.trash...no wonder kids now a days grow up having no respect for authority.  Donald Trump is the President of the United States of America. You may not like or respect the man because of whatever reasons, but you should have respect for the title he holds whether you feel he deserves it or not.Was he on drugs?

I've heard diehard fans saying all his albums are in the garbage right now.nIf you were never a fan, Eminem won't miss you. The truth is, you were never a fan, you just hopped on the bandwagon because, it was another opportunity to spread your racist whitesupremacist agenda. There has been way too much black rappers and even latino rappers who has outclassed Em's style but you didn't care, but all of a sudden a Whitman pops up and all of a sudden he's the best. Just like he himself admitted, if Em was black, you wouldn't have shown so much support and and now that he shows he stands for equality, your true agenda just showed up. Racist white supremacist bastards.yo M...rather than just trying to be part of the propaganda negativity Media train that's fueling more hostility and DivisionnnPositivity United through peace is what should be the mission but just because you have a platform in your famous doesn't mean that people will continue to listen when you ranting and ravinnstand back take a look Now Understand we all know government of the crooks I'm selfeducated and Behind the Walls for years I've read many books but I don't do this for kicks if it looks or for tricks or just for the hell of it to bullshtttt....nTrying to get your attention and by the way also I meant to mentionnnAlways Remember that united we stand divided we fall nnyo M... if you're down for the good of all... then pls recognize that love is the weapon you're coming with too much hatred you need to get to Steppin nnN anything else you're going to TrynnFirst start by apologizing to America and correct yourselfnnornya gonna wreck yourself.nnlol trudat ...

Cause you a cracker, you white peckerI find it absolutely amazing how people are saying he's lost touch with his fans. You couldn't really be his fans if you're racist conservatives. Ever listen to Mosh? It's crazy, 100 years later and half of America have forgotten why they fought in WW2 and have started back peddling to ole Jim Crow days.  well done.Eminem your poor thing. I hope you are feeling better.eminem is old af nowCan't he blast a new album?I lost all respect for mm being a sale out. looks like he's paid off . Trump did introduce slim years ago now he turns around and disses the man in office who actually cares for its people. guess he's to rich like Rosie . nre jump start your fame originally like how you got famous. I was a huge fan from your first major album slim shady up until this day 10/18/2017 when I heard this B's that's not like you at allAww someone is trying to stay relevantDid he fall down and hurt himself again. Sounds like this guys brain is fried. I was his fan until he told all his fans to go fuk off in this video. He so week and used like a dirty used condemn. Nobody even respects him or his flip flopping gay fudge packing sorry wack a$$ rhymes. He sucks now. Probably from now on too. Everyone knows Eminem is a total sellout..I wonder how much Hilary paid him to make this.Everybody that's woke has been waiting for this Americans are turning against their government. Americans know there is more of us than them. _ I'm absolutely loving this and happy to be apart of this generation.Awww_ I got a middle finger from MarshallHi everyone, I made a remix by adding these Eminem's words on a music on my yt channelObama accumulated over 10 trillion it Debt . More than  every orther president combined. Not trump. Ask hilary. + your freestyle sucked and you planned it. You suckthis is poetry slam..Am in the only one who thinks this was vastly overrated and down right cringe?He looks old damn  Just like the NFL you take the bait.  I listen to music escape political bullshit not to hear this.  I used to like you but what ever Freedom of speech as they say Social media is what's wrong with this world.Man, just sing..ok? No talks about politics hohohOMG.nI love this.nI really understand this most Hip Hop I'm slow to understand.nThank you.nContinue speaking against injustice.NOW WHY ISN'T THE PRESIDENT CALLING FOR THE ARREST OF MARSHALL MATHERS?I'm not a trump supporter. And I agree with everything he said here. But this freestyle was one of Eminem's worst. It wasn't that good.Well if he does build it i hope it reinforced with bricksnnRacism is the only thing he fantastic 4, and he orange. nnThis was so shit i find it hilarious people are trying to praise him for it when hes clearly fallen off with his freestyle skills...Subscribe to me and I will sub back just reply I subed <3he's beginning to feel like a crap god, crap godCome on WE NEED SLIM SHADY PLEASE slim Come backHopefully he able to reach some of his fans who support trump, the man has a platform and is using it.not to mention when he says calm before the storm what in the hell...  em new he had the balls for anything and everything he didnt need to announce anythingn anyone thats a true em lover knows this fact.wow its still relevant I am gonna keep making more spoof videos on it people are still posting like seconds agoOmg that so does not look like him who is that???Lol at all the white racist Trump fans mad at Eminem.You're not black0:47 wtf he gets lights in his eyes _ぃEveryone who's saying it sounds like shit wasn't really listening to what he said. Disregarding his words because it didn't sound good without a beat. You people got your priorities all fucked up.lol butthurt Trump supporters in the comment, 99% of their excuse is ''Eminem suck now'' awww did you used to be a fan? Like he said, he will do a line between you and him, not his fault if you support a dumbassTo those Trump dickriders saying omg eminem is such an idiot rip eminem hes stupid .. Just try to get as half famous and rich and successful as he is then your opinion MIGHT matter a bit. But for now, keep being toxic, thats all y all good for. :)This is the one rap battle Eminem lost. And Donald Trump (God bless him) didn't say one thingdumb Americans Y'all stupid af... y'all lack common sensenstop kissing this white boy's ass and watch this videonDamn never thought it'd happen...but the damage of drugs caught up to EmThe pot calling the kettle black. It only takes listening to his lyrics to see that you could not be more of a hypocrite. Either drag yourself down with Trump and be honest about everything you stand or stood for, or stop repeating the same ol' crap with a different spin on it.Thats the first time ive seen him wear a chaindamn em you must have wanted a fan energy boost or some shit , you hated politics and they hated you , now all of a sudden this ? how much and who paid you ???Eminem is a legend, nJust lost a bit of his talentWtf is my mans illness.  Cause Colin protested and trump made a comment about them doing it..... always been a fan of em,  favorite rap artist etc etc.  But now I'm not sure yo... this shit made no sense. Almost like he just wanting black people thinking look guys,  I'm with you,  I'm rapping on behalf of you all,  look at me.  And trump never said anything bout black people,  or the black players  being spoiled rich  athletes etc etc.  And now all this gonna do is cause even more racist tension and issues that were not there before and don't need to be,  by saying what he just did And being as influential as the man is knows he has power to alot of people's to cause these shits,  dividing America. He's paid to do all this shit people,  don't you realize this man. He is a rich illuminati affiliated high up involved with agenda to rip us all part from eachother and all the ones that are saying your the Shit EM,  good job em,  ohhh he cares so much about all this shit , PLEASE wake the HELL up peoples,  for real.  Common sense,  well only common to the woken the ones still asleep will not get it and will always follow the Hurd. Funny thing is,  he called out trump to say he's be flying around till the bombing stopped,  but, I bet EVERYTHING,  that this man right here talking this shit,  would he the first one in his underground mansion underneath his upper mansion. Also waiting for everything to stop.... He aint gonna be out there in the front lines helping us or taking action on the bullshit he just spoke and if ANY OF you believe that then I truly feel bad for yous,  sincerely.  We as Americans need to stick together with all colors  and sex.  Real talk.  Trump ain't rhe problem,  it's shit like this from powerful peoples getting us lower funded Americans rowd up angry ready to fight everyone,  going against our  leader no matter what we think bout him.  Ain't am easy job by any means PERIOD.  And fir anyone that's a believer of our Lord and savior which I hope everyone reading this stuff,  thw bible specifically says that we are to respect and follow our leader because they are out leader.somewhere on the lines of that but it most defInitely says were supposed to respect our leader as in our President .  What this man just did or is doing I should say is teaching the young people that look up to him unfortunately and the older fols such as myself all to go.against the bible and fall into the big agenda,  depopulation,  dumbing down and bring upon us our own destruction  . Understand yes this does sound a little outlandish but if you do your research and study for yourselves and read, look and pay attention to every thing happening in our world today specially our own country you will see how outlandish its actuallY NOT Much more id like to say friends and things i know I probably forgot but its late, I'm very tired and gonna stop before I start going off in different directions off topic etc etc.  Plus my wife is giving me that look,  ha. Time for bed .  Thanks everyone for your time and have a blessed day when your up.... take care and be safe.lol no captions are available for this videoAs a black Republican, I see nothing wrong with this rap.Real cringeworthy. Also good job on taking the George Bush style You're with us or against us mentality. Real shows whose the rational side here.650,000 white men gave their lives trying to abolish slavery..but every white man had ancestors that enslaved african americans..you are not as intelligent as tupac,never will beeminem actually white nope. all he knows is how to feel sorry for himself. and his rhymes making up words that aren't real isn't rhyming.   its what a first grader would do.  i almost feel sorry for him.  hes totally lost and doesnt even know it.Overrated artist John Doe....get a gripIs this ememnCRING KING 2K17Wow. That was embarassing.EMINEM 2020?He lost his 'humph'What a DOUCHECheck my boy outWhen is Curtain Call Coming?Eminem died a decade ago anyways..he always rhymin with orangeOhhh dayumn #UNCENSOREMINEM Donald Chump deserve that, big brops to Eminem.kinda cringy............ _Eminem 4 life _解_this bet star warsGo on EmDJ Cummerbund  Hey TrumpnDonald Trump is Like HitlerTruthYoHe works better withs mom's spaghetti.I bet Slim Shady have shade  10 pounds after this stupid rant.Colin Capanigger started all this BS.Kendrick lamar watch outGod he is your president he deserves respect and you humiliated not only him, but also people who voted for him. I think you set this video as a model for upcoming generation to mock and abuse whoever you can.Just because he's an idiot , doesn't mean you can censor his wordsSomebody please get him his purple pillsOnce a legend always a legendThat was just embarrassing, from the best to the absolute worst choker, needs to start smoking weed again, every year more and more places are legalizing anyway.Eminem please shave your beard it don't look good in my opinionAll You just did was separate this country even more and fueled a fire that is already lit good job you must of been that broke to come out and do this. This doesn unite Americans and just shows the other side of the hate. The same racism you think he shows you just did in return. I served this country for 8 years and i don agree by any means how this was handled. Take some notes from logic that how you unite a divided front. #washedup #hasbeenOh God. Assaults, robbery, drug use,  killing women, homosexuals, rape, incest, abortions are all on the table BUT RACISM?? Hey bub That's taking it TOO far Eminem WON'T stand for thatHe literally just threw a little temper tantrum. Jumping up and down because he can't get his way. It's pathetic. Calling out his own fans, because he thinks it means something. Dumbest stuff he's pulled yet. Rip slim shady. You died years ago, Somewhere between relapse and recovery. We used to use your music to escape politics. Now you're just another Kanye.Upchurch just roasted your fake ass just like ICP didboooooooy. best of 2017 down#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #DonaldTrumpIsGreatidiotchild like idiotHave a nice day and sub my channel new videos coming soonHey Eminem, let me go ahead and spit at younI'm gonna tell you straightup, dude, you're so hypocritical,nit's pitifulnYou call Trump a racist, yet you call him orange again and againnFrom what I know, the definition of racism is making fun of one's skin.nnYou think you're such a tough guy? Well, when you battle, it's Hollywood: fake scenes, fake dudes, and film crewsnTrump is fighting real enemies of America  ISIS, North Korea, and fake newsnnYou call Trump a Neo Nazi; are you that much of a pinhead? I mean, put both of you in a police lineup, you're the one that looks like a skinheadnnYou made your millions on the backs of young black men, infecting the minds of teens, selling them drugs, sex, and sin....nnNOW you suddenly care about gun violence? I'm about to lose it You are such a hypocrite because YOU GLORIFY GUN VIOLENCE IN EVERY OTHER LINE OF YOUR MUSICnnYou have a gift for rapping, so why not use it for good,n'cause your music has probably killed as many young black kids as your homie planned parenthoodnnYou talk about police brutality? Dude, is it even computing,nthat you're mad at the same cops that you and your boys rap about shooting?nnYou think Trump treats women bad? Listen to what YOUR songs say about females Bro, you are so lost that *cough, cough*..................nit's like you're hanging around Hillary's emails.nnYou're mad at Trump because he's rich? You yourself rap about money, so shouldn't he be your hero?nOh wait a minute, you rappers are just jealous because his bank account ends with a couple extra zeros nnYou act like you fight for civil rights? Raise your black power fist like an OG?nLast I checked, Trump donated more money than all of you to the NAACPnnSo while you used up your skill in your 40's, and your popularity and money are halfspent........nYou can say what you want about Trump; he is still our presidentA total has been.  He'll be forgotten again by the end of next week.Lmao all I see is butthurt Trump supporters attacking Em. Dont see a single counter argument to any of his rhymes.  Smfh._ since when rappers know anything?How can anyone support Trump? I'm not into politics but plz tell me how Trump is a good president or a better president then Obama? I don't recall being concerned about the world ending when Obama was president...This is really  gaybruh that was amazingAny liberals want to be honest and say that wasn't that great or is that not allowed in your cult? You guys are like ScientologistsTrump is so own by Eminem.What's a matter Eminem scared your black counterparts won't like you if you talk shit about Obama Pfft goat my ass, more like sheep of all time my reaction after watching thisHe's gon get rid of all immigrants lmaoooo finny voiceYo, eminems beard made me trip, i thought it was some bum with a beard, wearing a chain dat he stole dat was rappinThis is hilarious.

Let's just see what Trump does.can people understand that he's freestyling and adressing real issues in the american system due to donald trumpEhh still like your music and trump so...Stan was lucky he killed himself in order to avoid seeing what became of Eminem.Em was for free speech. Anti gov, counter culture, antiEstablishment. Why is he doing what every celeb has done already. Im tried if it.They gave him a pass to say that... Ain't falling for it...nBut that fantastic four reference tho...I guess all those black dudes behind Eminem got nothing to say... smh.That doesnt even look like himSome of the dumbest shit iv'e ever heardThat's enough cringe for today.Did Eminem loose his talent or what? This is teribleHi, I am a White Christian American. I work in the Mainstream media. As an ideal father and husband it's my duty to provide my family so that me and my family can live LAVISHLY. But my salary is not enough for that. So I have to take bribes from Hindus and Muslims and lobby for them ( even if it directly or indirectly harms other White Christian Americans ). I don't even hesitate to say what Hindus say, 'Jai Hind'. I don't even hesitate to say what Muslims say, 'Allah Ho Akbar'. I don't even hesitate to say 'Death to White Christians'. At the same time I wish myself and my family a happy and LAVISH life.Before you treat him like some righteous activist championing a just cause, may I remind you that he's dropping an album next month and is performing the EXACT same stunt every major rapper does before a major release: dissing celebrities to gain relevancy and attention. Trump's been president for almost a year, and Em decides to speak on it now, right before he drops an album? Please.This needs to be the national anthem for as long as Trump is president.The text is killing ithe's the new king of crapStupidity will bring this country down, especially if you believe in this he is saying.Why he hating our president he the people that are going to start world war 3This is most idiotic thing I have ever seen. Yeah, you're hard, there, Marshall. You'd pee your pants if you ever came into contact with The Donald.Everyone knows Em can do 100x better than this, he probably thought about this freestyle in 2 minutes. If he took his time to write a diss track about trump he would murder his career, like he murdered Ja Rule's career .speaking the truth about a races president that no one respect be honest he's a member of the KKKfuk up, where have you been for the last fuking 3 yearsPure shit. This is idiotic. You used to be good.That's Why you're a Legend. Screaming shady till I die .I would say that we've officially reached the peak of free expression with this one.  I fucks with itI'm not with youThis is the most hypocritical freestyle of all time. Anyone remember when Eminem was endorsing Trump and hanging out with him? Both Trump and Eminem are very similar, they have been slandered by the feminists and new outlets for saying offensive yet true things. They both hate the mainstream. Oh, and also, Eminem is from Detroit, one of the most problematic places in the world that Trump promised to fix up.Ok look I love em but got this is shi but bro this sucks don get me wrong I love em I been a fan since I was little but it sucks come on em all loveWhy can't everyone just *love* each other? Eminem is just dividing us up even more..Idk, seems like a joke...Eminem is backEminem wearing those Sashiko NMDs im seriously confused. Wtf is thisWell that was classless.EminiemRap God What a selloutMosh 2.0?FireEminem a bitchcmon its eminem don't censor it like wtfProps to Obama? Yet thanks to Trump, ISIS is fleeing from Raqqa???When he went redneck_Eminem Now Supports Trump  :Dn uThank you EminemTrue thoughYoTY  VAJCOSDude went hard lol180,000+ Butthurt Trump Supporters LMAOEminem over Trump any day__Damn that was raw.He went hamI DONT HEAR THEM DUMP TRUMP SUPPORTERS TALKIN SHIT NOWYou wreckt himAGAINSTYou amazing manwoohoooooo donald thumbs uptop 3 wrappers:n1. plasticn2. papern3. aluminum foil   Fock off Marshall  you chug cocks.Garbage.Title should be called:Eminem *KILLS* Donald TrumpEminems freestyle so sick made me vomit Stay retired u monkey jokeThis is kinda terribleNo respect worst rap ever Eminem highly disappointedBaby _もThat isn't him..LMAO he killed himThis shit is trash dawg he actually had a reason to hate on bush lol.It's very bold of him to risk his fan following..... characterstic of an honest and strong man Eminem tried to kill Trump but commited suicide...........donald trump get pressed by the legend EMIN3M _ This Is litGuys... I figured out the Trump/Against Trump debate. nnTrump supporters hear his words/theories and agree with him. After all, a lot of what he says makes sense IF IT WAS THE TRUTH. THE PROBLEM IS, a lot of what he says are outright lies and fabrications of the truth. So people that pay attention to the details realize that he is wrong and is making this country worse. nnGood intentions on both sides, just one side needs to pay attention to the details and the reality of the situation a bit closer....I'm a Muslim American and I support Trump.I hate the orange piece of shit,just as much as i hate this wigger.Did Em just choke when he said stop? Looks like he choked the first time in his careerThis is not freestyle. This is memorized you idiotsYou realise Trump was voted in right ? Maybe u should vote a different way next time . Tho i do understand his opponent is just as evil and useless . Hmm hard to choose from 2 piles of shit I guesslol who this guy? His irrelevant head ass, trying to get hype. LameThis was a nice way to commit career suicide lol. Goodbye EminemWhen you rap about rape, drugs, sex and killing but still get support from Liberals and AntiTrump SupportersLoses half of his fans album flops Money doesnt do nothing for you demon possessed bitch so shut the fluck mnm chump..you have no balls..if you did u piece of devil you would run for president and help all your fellow freaks..This is my opinion but this doesn't sound that goodI love this guy, he's got the balls to say what he feels and everyone else is affraid to do so. Yo Shady :)i hate trump, voted for obama and hilary, born and raised in metro detroit, and a huge fan of eminem. but i cant stand that kneeling shit during the anthem. so now i cant be an eminem fan anymore? wow of thx EmDAMN he aged, but this is impressiveEven eminem needs to use Trump for PR and promoting his new album, hahahaha. Would be nice if celebrities didn't lecture us about what is rightHey Eminem, thanks for your support.. take care, stay strong.Wow that was bad Eminem used to be pretty good back in the day. What happened to him?0:03 when you realize one of them niggas in the back had kryptonite in their pocketsI love Eminem but this is sucks.  I'm not talking about the subject of Trump (exactly) just saying it does nothing for me.is this really eminem ni think this in notAll u jerks who believe its just a freestyle ,a Cypher, Marshall presented for the BET..open your eyes..coz its a message and ''the calm before the storm'' thats soon to rise..to blow off such sophisticated political criminals in suits and ties as Donald Trump coz  ''Racism is the only thing he is fantastic for''....love and respect to sir Mr. Marshall Bruce Mathers III..love and respect to the former president Mr. Barack Hussein obama II for his noble deeds..heartfelt support and acceptions from Nepal. America.. unite and rise against..../ .Yall should at least respect eminem for being brave enough to make these statementsI this an ad for peer pressure? All the weird looking fucks in the background are black. Eminem is a scared little white bitch...The only one with the balls to stand up and say it. Can always count on EminemEminem looks so old but he is still beastI'm just here for the Regalto be honnest dafuk is this? not heard much from eminem for ages then he do this? guess its one way to get popular again knowing half murica hate trump and half love him so ether way his doomed to get supporters whit it, not hard to see his just after publicity when he go from rapping about killing, lyrics  and how good he is to political crap lol.nBut dont get me wrong i like some of his songs but when he do shit like this just for publicity and never had anything to do whit political crap before it just get pathetic.nPS. before the election the left always screamed trump would nuke everyone and so on, well how long have he been in office now? not one nuke dropped, where are all the camps for coloured people the left said trump would make?nits really amazing people actualy go around still ripping on him after been proven wrong over and over.nbefore anyone think im a trump supporter im not from murica so yeah didnt vote for him and i couldnt vote for him i simply seen what he done good and bad and compared it to other presidents through the years and of what i seen trump already done alot more good than 2 times voted obama lolHe looks like Mariah Carey's impersonation of himThis is trash if y'all werent dumb you would know that donald trump is really a saviorThis wasn't freestyle.nThis was slam poetry.I thought he was smarter than that . Even with all his resources he doesn't realise there is more to it than left and right. We need to unite not all this divide and conquer shit. Either Eminem is stupid which I doubt is possible with his ryming ability, he is wilfully ignorant or he knows what he is doing and choosing to divide so others can conquer. Awesome remix Same guys that did the Antoine Dodson oneAMEN...High five for Freddie Gray <3 Still fighting for Freddie Still wanna know know how a dude 's head was dislocated from his spine???? And NOT one fuckin person was held accountable???Nice freestyle...but why does he keep doing his freestyles in parking lots & abandoned warehouses?Must be the acoustics.If this wasn't a freestyle, He would have destroyed trump.God hears us one day hel would get red of Donald trump amenAnyone here remember the band Eagles?Weird. I guess it's hip. Oh well, I thought there'd be music with the wordsI don't like to be given and ultimatum so i choose neitherGood message, not so good freestyle but there were some good partsEminem look like an old dadIs he emenimnHis look is very  changeC R I N G E   One of my top fave rappers ever. Always on point.Like the message but no flowYo this is real lolMinority groups like Trump voters need to understand that Eminem speaks for America.he just told the future basically because that gentlemen that was just ambushed in Africa was in Iraq rip much love to all that serve for our freedom. and can't forget the ones that stand for it to. but happy belated birthday marshal I join you on the same day I'm a tremendous fan. I support you to the end. I'm not a s.t.a.n lmao. much love from iowaI was moved by eminem He gave it to him. He is one of the greatest to ever rap.Oh god. you sad little twat. you've become the very thing you built your career criticising... a sell out media puppet desperately trying to claw back cultural relevancy by jumping on the hate trump band wagon. I wonder if this childish tirade has anything to do with your new album coming out soon.nwashed up hasbeen, media hack who's run out of ideas... that's how you ended up eminem. congratulationssorry,em that was lameThis is junkFACK TRUMPLegend#fuckputinis than eminem?Sub gor sub_You're orange so edgyLast attempt to grasp fame.playback on 1.5x gives old eminem vibesEminem 8 yearsThis Is OverratedEm lost itCan u stop removing dislikes? ThanksepicBuild that wallGarbage.Even Eminem Is Old He is still goodMisogyny is the only thing you fantastic for.I thought this guy was supposed to be a rapper  his shit don't even rhyme. why don't you rap about hillary carry hot sauce in her purse. That bitch is the real racist  talks down to black people, lies to get their vote, then forgets about emI used to like Eminem until he became retarded, well in that case, Ive always hated himSounds like some has  been that needed some publicity because he slowly fading away .  this shit wack.  m&m is a hasbeen , washed up, just sayin this shit so he still looks cool in the black community eyes...s u c k slame one trick pony and that trick is old. time to grow up and get a real job you're almost 45.Is this a cena rap?What an idiot He looks like in deep need of money.yall dumb. mane did this actin out for straight publicity....and he sure got y'all...smhI made a remix of this freestyle with an instrumental . If you want to hear how this sounds with music you can check out on my channel ;)Go back to shitting on your mom and singing about killing your babies mom you punk bitchThis is coming from sexist and abusive Eminem lmao, yes he was the greatest of his time and is one of the hip hop greats but he is dumb nowHaha wow speaking about our president, blows my mind. Super disrespectful. I wasn't a big Obama or Bush fan but I would never disrespect them like this. Maybe Eminem should move to a different country. I guess Eminem doesn't like me because I support trump haha dang.Sucka MC Holy shit this is wack Thanks for proving my point that's your wack Bitch Ass chumpIsn this the same guy that used to call people faggots and queers and stuff? ike Elton john im just a mean cocksucker?Here's a bar Eminem wears diamonds that Africans mine out a dark cave.. Just so he can deceive us and light up the stageThis was honestly the worst selection for US President in history. The fact that we as Americans actually allowed this election to take place is something we should all be ashamed of. nnWhether you voted for Hillary or Trump, deep down you know they both were no where near what we needed as our President, especially in times like these. nnBut instead of uniting and making REAL change, this election is a tool to divide us further. Demo... Repu... two sides of the same coin people. And as for Eminem, he's  only fueling the fire because that is what he has been told to do. Keep us divided. Keep us weak. Keep us distracted. nnIf Eminem was as real as he claims he is, he'd be rapping about what is really going on behind closed doors. Not about some puppet President that holds as much power as he is allowed to by his masters.nnAnd I love how a group of black men stay silent in the background during this entire segment. Letting a white man speak for them and get the final say, of course.Hahahahhaaha guess he forgot Obama dropped.. More than 65 thousand bombs... A year... Every year... Of his residency... LolThat 1 million likes is such a beautiful thing.ear rapeWell ... Another  puppetThis is shit.Do some cardio. Your commie cuck ass is pantingGoddamn Eminem is getting oldalso shit rapweak as shit. Written ASF. freestyle my ass.Yeah sick tan eminem 2017Screw Trump and screw white people.All these trump supports and people who aren't even from the US but making bad comments are weak Just scheming. Obviously you do not know Eminem, nothing about what's been obviously going on in politics, or what is a freestyle is. Go take a seat  like kudos to Slim Shady for this. Y'all feelings hurt That's the only reason y'all cringing and complaining.. Sorry but a wake up call is due. Y'all like a pimple face, indignant, teenager who don't want to wake up for 7am class.  Stop the whining. He just took y'all to school.this is shitSounds like a broken CNN record.Shalom Eminem. We all thank you for this masterpiece. Globalists will run the world All races, cultures and traditions will disappear. You are one of our best puppets in music industry. Are you interested in playing a role in a new Hollywood movie?Trump doesn't deserve so much hate, he's trying to save our country from what its become and restore it. We need to take a stand against the SJW Black lives matter, feminists and LGBT scum that are ruining this once great land.I just burnt all his cds and deleted all his songs. Eat Shit and die EminemSo..basicly his tought of procces is''if you dont hold the same opinion on politics as me,well sorry you can't be my friend,lol. What a pathetic cu nt,mindset of a middle school child he has. Hahahahathe first half was so cringeHe say trump gonna bounce when the bombs start dropping? U think eminem wouldn't do the same? Another rich hypocrite. fyi i don't like trump either. or hillary or obama. the whole system is screwed up. Next election let's elect a bunch of sane homeless americans to office. Instead of a bunch of rich pedos and rapists. cuz our current elected officials and celebrities are all too rich to understand what it's like to live paycheck to paycheck. but that's how they keep us slaves. And they use rich icons like eminem and trump to keep the agenda going. controlled opposition. keepin us divided so we don't work together for real freedom. keepin us on our phones and computers. so we don't talk face to face.  labeling us black, white, yellow, brown, etc... to put us in boxes. separate.  we are all humans who want freedom, peace and happiness. Stop buying their albums and stop paying taxes and see how quick these rich assholes change their tune.Eminem should be the next PresidentCan ayone tell me why he's such a goat?He gots a point  slimshady100%Thumbs up EminemWE HATE TRUMPThe last time I saw Eminem was when mockingbird came out.

Shame on YouTube and their gatekeepers Pathetic.Bruh he said let give Obama props tf he do again...oh yeah raised debt that right.i never figured this guy as a try hardima die hard eminem fan, but tbh he sounds like shit without a beatWhy is this acapella? It sounds like a spoken poemHave you guys even heard a legit freestyle? It's exactly like this.Em ur a rap god and a truth god. Thank you. Good to see ur still kicking ass. Love for life shady.I made a remix of this freestyle with an instrumental . If you want to know how this rap sounds with music you can check out on my channel ;)Didn't see you right wingers this fired up when those disphits in Charlotseville flashed Hitler salutes and swastikas.Bump this in the club...Tell me y'all didn't let that Fantastic Four bar go over your heads #Fire _The fact that he is serious makes this hilarious.Endosement compensation. Look at the websites contributing to his video.  Indirect beneficiaries.... Capitalism at its Best.nnPS I been a fan of Eminem since he started coming up. Not hating just personal observation.Eminem noticed Puerto Rico わ_ what a blessing thanks Slim20th trending in Australia, used to be 2. 1 million likes The world is with u Em Thanks slim for standing upwhy is he going offNext time you Americans are faced with a shit situation like you were with this past election, spoil your votes. It's says a lot more than note voting at all and does less damage than voting on impulse. I mean, us in Canada have a vagina for a prime minister but you guys elected a madman.This is a brave man, to make a statement, with no one else's support, no backbeat; true freestyle, in such a sensitive political landscape. nnF*ck walking on eggshells, I came to stompI don't know if trump is a good president because I am not in states but anyone who says captured soldiers are losers is not a nice person .When your white but blacker than your black friends.nnThese niggas in the back lol.. nDefinitely ride or dies for MarshallGuess whoes back,back again.?nShady's back tell a friendThank you Eminem, you are 100% right.  And God willing that Orange President will keep talking stupid, and lose himself a job real quick. Eminem speaks for Americans and common sense.Damn could a thought that one through alittleyawn...Gahhhhhhh damnI love em n trump tbis ryhmes are sickwowhaha jkTrump isn't 94Lyrics anyoneThat jump doe8 Miles Is Still A Banger Ahlie _>;)Fire in da boof Still listeningSooo many butthurt Trump supporters from these facts My man fuck Donald TrumpThis sounded like SupaHotFire. Seriously M&M.Hes back hes backYou_Gonna_Rule_Rap_World_Again_As an outsider to your country, can someone please intelligently explain to me what Trump did exactly?Eminem come to king city California see what happens....        make America great again Eminem you just proved your a sell out and a tool for the globalist you probably jerked of haver weinstein to get famous u sell out rolling around with a gun with no bullets. Your a joke And snoop dogs a sell out to. Start your civil war see what happens ; )He is a good rapper, but its hard to disagree with this..nnEminem is a Complete IdiotnIsn't it an amazing coincidence how rappers all loved Trump, but then he suddenly became a racist when he took on the establishment?nSorry...nnnnnnnBut your bars are excruciating to listen to. You keep on having those awkward silences.Wow, black people are just destined to be bitter and angry forever.  Sorry,  but there isn't a black person alive that was picking cotton and was denied their right to vote or use of the same restrooms and water fountains as everyone else...get over your egos. Em. Practice what you preach. You wanna walk a mile in his shoes? You can't even put together a sentence that makes cents and, you wanna talk about all the others and then other countries and then his grandpa. Bitch please you used to be the one who everyone would hang from your D Eminem, your no longer relevant. Stick to your sick rhymes and the good times.I used to like you but now I don't keep your political expressions to yourself WIGGER.You were a hole lot better 2 years agoPeople...Stop supporting this.  Stop supporting hate.  Stop supporting division.  Stop supporting the notion that we hate each other.  Stop supporting the goal to improve our country.  Stop supporting suppression of free speech....... n Instead, start to love, start to unite, start believing that love unites us, be proud that our country represents freedom (it's not perfect, but it's the best country on earth.... period), and start understanding that our words define our reality, for better or for worse, let the conversations control our unity, not the media, not the govt, just the people.  nnWe all want the same thing... Love, and no fear.I know elementary kids that can rap better.# sell outis this white or black privilege ;)   oh wait, it's just pure garbageEminem sucks, hes a has been. Youtube how come u running ads with this kind of vid. What happen to ur rules u push on other youtubers that dont even push these kind of agendas.I would have respected Em more if he would have stood up during obamas 2nd term when the police was killing unarmed AfricanAmericans  left and right like fruit flies.I've never seen someone stick a gun in their mouth and pull the trigger that many times before. #RIPeminemTHIS IS STUPID ILL EXLAIN WHY IF ANYONE CARES ENOUGH TO KNOW HE ACTUALLY SOUNDS LIKE RAP BATTLE DISASTERsucks i used to like himAt the end of the day Trump is still president and Eminem isI THOUGHT THIS WAS FAKEM's aged dammm.... His soul hasn't.Dont ever forget who u r eminem, u grew up on the streets, poor, and the only thing that got u here was ur talent, and u might just end up like u used to beOh boi. I just love me some quality division.he is a confirmed eed traitor I say deathCan someone tell me who the guys in the back are?Politics aside, Eminem can do way better than this.Regardless of political affilation, you have to admit that this is a steaming pile of garbage. Holy shit it's bad.Racism is the only thing he fantastic 4  cause that how he gets the F*cking rocks off when he orange OMG That one hella barYour flow was weak,nAnd Your Lyrics Were WeirdnIt took you 44 years to grow a beard.Damn Em has jumped the shark. His scripted freestyle was straight ass. Doesn't make sense. Weak. I guess he's just following where most hip hop has gone... down the toilet. Enjoy the turds.Don't know what some of you are talking about Eminem still inform still the greatest and he taught Donald Trump unfortunately our president a lessonSha@yfucked ti you lost manso did eminem go threw puberty?This guy never runs out on hunger.The goatlol what a dumb assCringe.......sadly had to dislikeEminem is a whinny bitch.REPORT: THIS VIDEO POST VIOLATES YouTube's TERMS OF SERVICE AND SHOULD BE Demonetized AND REMOVED ACCORDING TO ITS OWN POLICY... However it's unlikely that it will never happen with VEVO or any other leftist ideological propagandists channel's... I THINK I WOULD OFFER A GREAT AMOUNT OF RESPECT FOR GOOGLE AND IT'S YOUTUBE DIVISION OF IT WOULD REVISE ITS TERMS OF SERVICE TO BE PLAINLY SPELLED OUT TO SAY IT WILL DELETE, SUSPEND AND OR DEMONETIZE,  AT ITS OWN DISCRETION AND WILL, ANY VIDEO POST OR CHANNEL THAT ITS STAFF,  IN COOPERATION WITH THE DEEP STATE GOVERNORS , HAPPEN TO NOT AGREE WITH...ESPECIALLY CHANNEL'S THAT OPENLY EXPOSE THE TRUTH AND REALITY OF WHAT GOOGLE AND DEEP STATE ARE DOING TO US...SLIM Shady IS ALLOW TO PROMOTE VIOLENCE SGAINST A SITTING PRESIDENT AND GET PAID DOING SO, BUT I CANNOT DISSENT AND PUBLICLY POST A VIDEO DISAGREEING WITH HIM... AT LEAST BE HONEST AND REVISE YOUR TERMS OF SERVICE TO PLAINLY SAY ITS OUR BUSINESS, WE CAN DO WHAT WE WANT STOP HIDING BEHIND YOUR TERMS OF SERVICE AND COMMUNITY GUIDELINES AS IF YOU ADMINISTER THEM FAIRLY, ITS OBVIOUS TO A 3 YR. OLD  WHAT YOU'RE UP TO GOOGLE..............3...........2............1.......... DELETE......Lol, Eminem is a little bitch compared to Trump.4 MORE YEARSEm, ive been a fan since 2009 but I like trump and if you dont like it take that fist and cram it up your assYou people on the Left are just sad  Can you say Sore Loser's ? Sad  lolWait, is that a Grand National?It's dope. He stood up and stepped up. Respect Slim Shady.I respect his talent but it is not a kinda music video hehehe it is like a spoken poetry will full of emotions that can uplift our soulDamn, he look so different.give Obama props? for what all the debt that he and the left gave us to make us slaves....truth broI got chills and I didn't even want to like it.Why would Eminem say f*** you to a huge part of his fan base? These are the same fans that supported Shady and his rise to power as the best rapper? How could he alienate so many of these people? Without your fans you aren't anything. A lot of people hate Trump but this was a huge messed up thing to do to someone who has been sticking up for slim shady since day one  and now he wants to say f*** you to these people that were always fans of him.Fists high America bless up To u shadyI don't get any of this. Didnt Collin take the knee when Obama was president? He was the first to take the knee then and the media blasted him but now everyone wants to jump on board coz it's not Obama's America that is screwing things up. and Eminem is brave for this?eminem should join the armyWho is this? This doesn't look or sound like Eminem. It's this mandela effect?As redman said, Em was making a statement. He coulda came and blacked out with the deadliest rhymes and flow. But he wanted to talk, and make a statement and stand for the people and america. not to impress Hip hop heads and mumble heads.What i think a lot of folks are missing is the bit about trump flying around till the bombing stops. That a direct reference to the Presidential airplane, Air force one. Air Force One can withstan bomb blasts and can refuel while still flying at high altitudes, making possible to stay safe indefinitely during a nuclear war . Just throwing that context out there.I subbed for the Legendary EminemThis is by far the worst thing he has done, even though things have been on a clear downward trajectory for years now. Parking lots is where he should rap now.This one is for collin make a fist and keep that shit balled like donald the bitch best part respect eminemYou better give Obama props for dropping more bombs on innocents than GW.  Eminem baiting Trump is so predictableRise up Right on Eminem, keep it realI'm with you EminemWoah, who would've thought that standing up for others would piss of these righties so badly. Maybe we can just hug them out if existence.One of my favorites turned into a sheep so sad?This is why I love Eminem He says he wants to lower taxes but who gonna pay for his trips family golf and mansions I think is what he said at around 2:25 but uhh did u forget that trumps a billionaire he doesn need tax money nibba  Eminem wack these daysBut Im not a rapperIf you don realize why he went against Trump, it because Trump is a big thing right now, so he can gain a lot of popularity from this. I support Eminem, good freestyle also.Eminem has been around for as long as I can remember. It's like he's an immortal (comin through the portal (if u get the reference))Yup still sounds like a 13 year old...Its like rap and drugs at a young age stunts IQ for life.eminem came back and he got weird flow nowEminem is gonna lose a lot if he keeps going The way he's going  Eminem is on Obamas side and Hilary Clinton  side when Donald trump is just doing his job and trying to help people out and not try to control the world like Obama  and Hilary Clinton did so Eminem I'm not a fan anymore you have lost my respect for you and you can take what you said and turn it right back at you because you are disrespectful Eminem you are not the person I thought you were goodbye Eminem gross why does he like black peopleHe couldn't do it against Mariah Carey, now he tries dissing somebody else with insults. I thought he was better but apparently not, he's rich, butthurt and ignorant knowing that Obama deported more than 3 million people back in the day and invaded several countries where now you see ISIS spreading around. Obama signed a nuclear deal with Iran in order to provide a way for them to create a nuclear weapons and this whinning millionaire is supporting that? What about Libya ? Eminem is just another board chip piece of fu* who knows shit about the blessings he's received in comparisson to people in countries where the democrats have devastated lives for so long. I am just so glad I don't like his shitty music no longer. My comment ain't about supporting Trump, but Eminem is just another chess piece, just look at his fancy clothes while he singing about the poverty he's never lived. Just another Miley Cyrus on the way, brainwashed and completely out of place pretending he knows about politics just because he's got an oscar and fans to pay for his shows so he becomes richer. Underground? yeah, his crappy message is buried there already. Get your facts straight whiteprivileged rap singer in 2016 alone, the Obama administration dropped at least 26,171 bombs quote.... President Obama did reduce the number of US soldiers fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, but he dramatically expanded the air wars and the use of special operations forces around the globe. In 2016, US special operators could be found in 70% of the world nations, 138 countries _ a staggering jump of 130% since the days of the Bush administration.   bye and stop pretending you care about socials because you don't and you have made your money out of the same kind of politics Trump is putting over the table.he said this on BET awards wtf this isn't Eminem this is the lefties...  I really love Eminem and what he has come from and what he made and this is just bull shit ...... speak your mind Eminem...I am the way I am if I wasn't then why would I say I am...  In the paper the news every day I am if I wasn't then why would I say I am...  wtf is this em wtf....True words from a legend Murder Mitten He now looks like owen wilson owowI like this Eminem version better lol All you people in the comments sayin it was cringey I'm not gone it was a lil bit but it's not about that. He was trying to grab your attention by intentionally being awkward.eminem lost his edge. He dont sound as good as he used toDamnLegend LOL MARCHALLRap God???????????????192k butthurt trump dickridersU disliked because I hate censored vidsEMINEM FOR PRESIDENTEminem you right about trumpbeastLmfao that was greatYou got trump fucked upEm killed it.192k people nare trump supportersAmen Cancun mexico loves you.Hip Hop of 2017=PoliticsR.I.P trump WHO DISLIKED THIS?????nWHYYYYThat is Eminemah remember back when u used to fight against the system now your on this boobtube committing a sin trying to act like your not from Michigan u fooking dumby which one of those dude's behind you is your honey? calling donald Trump orange but your white so that's funny draw your line in the sand that's so bland that after your gay rap you might not have a single fan i will just stop here becoz your fooking queer. smh hahaWow, Has eminem had a lot of plastic surgery or botox or something?Better than that country music concert in Vegas LOLEminem you are now officially a hypocriteEm sit your ass down boi.nYou are in my top 5 nAt this moment. nU bsnHow much did bet pay you to dis trump?Coming from the guy who raps about raping women. I won even bother going after any of the inaccuracies, but I will say that that end bit is completely anti freedom of opinion. Also nice PC shots of random black dudes. Also what about the other 3 green berets who died along with him hm? The liberally media seems to just ignore them because they are white. They ALL deserve respect. Oh, and FYI, he never said he wanted to get rid of all the immigrants, or even all the illegal ones. Just the ones involved in illegal activity. That IT. IN FACT, he attempting to work with the ones already here...however it isn exactly healthy for our already in the toilet economy (thanks obama), to constantly be taking in more and more immigrants. Yeah they are people too, but there is ALREADY poverty and unemployment in the US, so before we start worrying about the problems of people in other countries, we ought to look after our own US citizen first REGARDLESS of ethnicity or skin tone.Garbage. Ie always been an Eminem fan but this is idiotic.I used to be a big Eminem fan, but the last few years he's proved he's full of ish, he used to be friends with donald trump. Now he hates him? he's becoming less and less relevant these days, because his music isn't good anymore. I get why he made this, look at the press he got from it, it's the popular narrative right now. I wish all the celebs would stay put of politics. smhall i heard was him heavy breathinghe sound like a robot when he rap wtf LOLthis is terrible em you are 50As much as I am a fan of Eminem, I have to disagree with him. He might say he stands with the military but the military's job is to execute the orders of the commander in chief and everyone I've met since I've been in has been an avid supporter of President Trump. And the getting rid of all immigrants really is annoying. He wants to get rid of illegal immigration, which happens to be against the law, hence the name. So Eminem, I'm sorry, been a fan forever but this is where I draw the line. Disrespect my president, you disrespect meHoly shit thats eminem i remembet when he rapped about his daughterYou keep that _ stuff away from us now wee not into anything queer, sorry.against you...... for AmericaM is an ILLUMINATE puppet.Crack head crazy Eminem haha, you have really take a turn for the worst, I guess the crack in walking up and down in your vainsYou love the same military that helped vote him in? Because if your fans who are military are trump supporters you just flipped them off you idiot. Yes a vast majority of the military voted him in. Maybe learn a little bit for you spit half assed freestyles.That don't look like eminemEminem better chill , he gone be the next Colin Kap Savage of the year goes to EminemTHE BALLS IN HIS MOUTH GREW OUT PUBIC HAIR ON HIS CHINEminem you still on drugs you a complete idiot losserNuclear holocaust?

Yeah he's a douche, but so are you  ;PEminem you should start making songs again like if you agreeWTF is this shit??I fucks wit it...lolEminem sucks assSad.
